Dear Hiring Manager, 
 
I am writing to express my interest in the coop position at your esteemed organization. I'm eager 
to bring my skills and passion to contribute to meaningful projects during the Winter Term 2024. 
 
In my eight-year tenure as a Machine Learning expert in the insurance industry, I have led 
transformative projects that significantly impacted the sector. Notably, during my tenure as a 
Consulting Actuary at Eckler Ltd, I led the creation and dissemination of industry machine 
learning models for vehicle rate groups. These models, adopted nationwide, not only showcased 
my predictive modelling skills but also demonstrated my ability to work on projects with 
substantial impact. My passion for innovation and continuous learning has led me to pursue a 
Master’s program in Software Engineering, furthering my technical acumen and adaptability to 
the ever-evolving tech landscape. 
 
With proficiency in Python, JavaScript, R, and other critical technologies, I possess the technical 
skill sets necessary for the position. My ongoing projects, such as the development of a web 
platform using Python and LLMs for automated document generation, showcase my practical 
experience in software development. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your 
team and leverage my experience in leading teams, strong analytical skills, and cross-functional 
collaboration expertise to drive impactful results. 
 
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my 
experiences and skills in greater detail and how they align with your needs. 
 
Sincerely, 
Lu Cao

You are a lawyer at a law firm that specializes in credit agreements and other debt instruments. Your job is to extract specified information from a Credit Agreement, as described in the following Data Definitions.

* tranche: the tranche of debt, like 'Senior Secured' or 'Mezzanine'
* quantum: the amount borrowed under each facility covered by the Credit Agreement, like 'Term Loan: $100,000,000; Revolving Facility: $250,000,000'
* financial_maintenance_covenant: if the agreement contains a covenant that the borrower must meet certain financial performance targets, the answer is 'Yes'. If the agreement does not contain this type of covenant, the answer is 'No'.
* addbacks_cap: Determine whether any "extraordinary expenses" are included in the calculation of the borrower's earnings as an "addback" or "added back". Examples of extraordinary expenses include start-up costs, restructuring costs, and synergies. If they are included, determine whether the agreement contains a "cap" on this "addback", and which specific "addbacks" the caps apply to. If there is a cap, the answer will identify the type of expense and the type of cap like, 'Synergies not to exceed 14% of EBITDA'
* MFN_threshold: In the context of credit agreements and financing, a "Most Favored Nation" (MFN) provision is a clause that ensures a lender receives treatment at least as favorable as any future lenders to the borrower. This clause is particularly relevant in scenarios where a borrower may seek additional financing after the initial loan agreement is made. The MFN provision safeguards the interests of the current lenders by ensuring that any more favorable terms offered to new lenders in future financings are also extended to them. Determine whether the agreement contains MFN language. If this language exists, determine the threshold, like '50 basis points'
* MFN_exceptions: Review the most favored nation language. Determine whether there are any exceptions where the protections in this section do not apply. Summarize those exceptions, like 'The MFN does not apply to loans made after a certain maturity date'
* portability: if the agreement contains exceptions to the change of control, the answer is 'Yes'. If the agreement does not contain such exceptions, the answer is 'No'.
* lender_counsel: The names of the law firms affiliated with the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, like 'Kirkland & Ellis LLP'
* borrower_counsel: The names of the law firms affiliated with the Borrower, like 'Ropes & Gray LLP'
* borrower: The name of the Borrower, like 'Acme, Inc., a Delaware corporation'
* guarantor: The name of the guarantor, if any, like 'Acme Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company'
* admin_agent: The name of the Administrative Agent, like 'Acme Bank, a Delaware corporation'
* collat_agent: The name of the Collateral Agent, like 'Acme Bank, a Delaware corporation'
* effective_date: The date of the agreement, like '06/01/2024'


For each data point, provide a citation from the agreement to support the answer, and provide an explanation for how you determined the correct answer.

minus (b) the sum of (without duplication and to the extent the amounts described in this clause (b) increased such Consolidated Net Income for the respective period for which Adjusted EBITDA is being determined) non-cash items increasing Consolidated Net Income of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries for such period (but excluding any such items (A) in respect of which cash was received in a prior period or will be received in a future period or (B) which represent the reversal of any accrual of, or cash reserve for, anticipated cash charges that reduced Adjusted EBITDA in any prior period);

A “Change in Control” shall be deemed to occur if:
 
(a)            any person, entity or “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Exchange Act, but excluding any employee benefit plan of such person, entity or “group” and its subsidiaries and any person or entity acting in its capacity as trustee, agent or other fiduciary or administrator of any such plan), other than the Permitted Holders, in a single transaction or in a related series of transactions, shall at any time have acquired direct or indirect beneficial ownership (as defined in Rules 13(d)-3 and 13(d)-5 under the Exchange Act) of voting power of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Borrower having more than 50% of the ordinary voting power for the election of directors of the Borrower (provided, that, for purposes of this determination, to the extent any person, entity or “group” includes both Permitted Holders and non-Permitted Holders (any such person, entity or “group”, the “Subject Group”) is a Subject Group, and the Subject Group does not itself constitute a Permitted Holder, then the outstanding Voting Stock of the Borrower directly or indirectly beneficially owned by such Permitted Holders in such Subject Group shall not be treated as being beneficially owned by such Subject Group), unless, in the case of this clause (a), the Permitted Holders have, at such time, the right or the ability by voting power, contract or otherwise to elect or designate for election at least a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Borrower; or
 
(b)            a “Change of Control” (as defined in (i) the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, (ii) any indenture or credit agreement in respect of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness with respect to the Senior Secured Notes constituting Material Indebtedness or (iii) any indenture or credit agreement in respect of any Junior Financing constituting Material Indebtedness) shall have occurred; or
 
(c)            Holdings shall fail to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, 100% of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of the Borrower.
 
In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a transaction in which the Borrower or a Parent Entity becomes a direct or indirect subsidiary of another person (such person, the “New Parent”) shall not constitute a Change in Control if (a) the equityholders of the Borrower or such Parent Entity immediately prior to such transaction beneficially own, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, at least a majority of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Borrower or such New Parent immediately following the consummation of such transaction, substantially in proportion to their holdings of the equity of the Borrower or such Parent Entity prior to such transaction or (b) immediately following the consummation of such transaction, no person, other than a Permitted Holder, the New Parent or any subsidiary of the New Parent, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, more than 50% of the voting power of the Voting Stock of the Borrower or the New Parent and (2) a person or group shall not be deemed to have beneficial ownership of Equity Interests subject to a stock purchase agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (or voting or option agreement related thereto) prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such agreement.


“Term B Loan Commitment” shall mean the obligation of the Term B Lenders to make a Term B Loan on the Closing Date in an aggregate principal amount equal to $850,000,000. The Term B Loan Commitment on the Closing Date is $850,000,000.

“Revolving Facility Commitment” shall mean, with respect to each Revolving Facility Lender, the commitment of such Revolving Facility Lender to make Revolving Facility Loans pursuant to Section 2.01(b), expressed as an amount representing the maximum aggregate permitted amount of such Revolving Facility Lender’s Revolving Facility Credit Exposure hereunder, as such commitment may be (a) reduced from time to time pursuant to Section 2.08, (b) reduced or increased from time to time pursuant to assignments by or to such Lender under Section 9.04, and (c) increased (or replaced) as provided under Section 2.21. The initial amount of each Lender’s Revolving Facility Commitment is set forth on Schedule 2.01 or in the Assignment and Acceptance or Incremental Assumption Agreement pursuant to which such Lender shall have assumed its Revolving Facility Commitment, as applicable. The aggregate amount of the Lenders’ Revolving Facility Commitments on the Closing Date is $500,000,000. On the Closing Date, there is only one Class of Revolving Facility Commitments. After the Closing Date, additional Classes of Revolving Facility Commitments may be added or created pursuant to Incremental Assumption Agreements.

Section 2.21      Incremental Commitments.
 
(a)            The Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent from time to time, establish Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, as applicable, in an amount not to exceed the Incremental Amount available at the time such Incremental Commitments are established (or at the time any commitment relating thereto is entered into or, at the option of the Borrower, at the time of incurrence of the Incremental Loans thereunder or, with respect to any Incremental Term Loan Commitment and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment established for purposes of financing any Permitted Business Acquisition or any other acquisition or similar Investment that is permitted by this Agreement, as of the date the definitive agreement with respect to such Permitted Business Acquisition, acquisition or similar Investment is entered into) from one or more Incremental Term Lenders and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Lenders (which may include any existing Lender) willing to provide such Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, as the case may be, in their own discretion; provided, that each Incremental Revolving Facility Lender providing a commitment to make revolving loans shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and, to the extent the same would be required for an assignment under Section 9.04(g) and the Issuing Banks (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), in each case, unless such Incremental Revolving Facility Lender is a Revolving Facility Lender prior to the establishment of such Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments. Such notice shall set forth (i) the amount of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments being established (which shall be in minimum increments of $5,000,000 and a minimum aggregate amount of $10,000,000, or equal to the remaining Incremental Amount or, in each case, such lesser amount approved by the Administrative Agent), (ii) the date on which such Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments are anticipated to become effective, (iii) in the case of Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, whether such Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments are to be (x) commitments to make additional Revolving Facility Loans on the same terms as the Initial Revolving Loans or (y) commitments to make revolving loans with pricing terms, final maturity dates, participation in mandatory prepayments or commitment reductions and/or other terms different from the Initial Revolving Loans (“Other Revolving Loans”) and (iv) in the case of Incremental Term Loan Commitments, whether such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are to be (x) commitments to make term loans on the same terms as the Term B Loans or (y) commitments to make term loans with pricing, maturity, amortization, participation in mandatory prepayments and/or other terms different from the Term B Loans (“Other Term Loans”).

(b)            The Borrower and each Incremental Term Lender and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such Incremental Term Lender and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment of such Incremental Revolving Facility Lender. Each Incremental Assumption Agreement shall specify the terms of the applicable Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments; provided, that:
 
(i)            any commitments to make additional Term B Loans and/or additional Initial Revolving Loans shall have the same terms as the Term B Loans or Initial Revolving Loans, respectively,
 
(ii)            the Other Term Loans incurred pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 2.21 shall rank pari passu or, at the option of the Borrower, junior in right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Term B Loans or be unsecured (provided, that if such Other Term Loans rank junior in right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Term B Loans, such Other Term Loans shall be subject to a Permitted Junior Intercreditor Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Other Term Loans rank junior in right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Term B Loans or are unsecured, such Other Term Loans shall not be subject to clause (vii) below),
 
(iii)            (A) the final maturity date of any such Other Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Term B Facility Maturity Date and (B) except as to pricing, amortization, final maturity date, participation in mandatory prepayments and ranking as to security (which shall, subject to the other clauses of this proviso, be determined by the Borrower and the Incremental Term Lenders in their sole discretion), shall have (x) substantially similar terms as the Term B Loans or (y) such other terms (including as to guarantees and collateral) as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
 
(iv)            the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any such Other Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Term B Loans,
 
(v)            the Other Revolving Loans incurred pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 2.21 shall rank pari passu or, at the option of the Borrower, junior in right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Initial Revolving Loans or be unsecured (provided, that if such Other Revolving Loans rank junior in right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Initial Revolving Loans, such Other Revolving Loans shall be subject to a Permitted Junior Intercreditor Agreement),
 
(vi)            the final maturity date of any such Other Revolving Loans shall be no earlier than the Revolving Facility Maturity Date with respect to the Initial Revolving Loans and, except as to pricing, final maturity date, participation in mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions and ranking as to security (which shall, subject to the other clauses of this proviso, be determined by the Borrower and the Incremental Revolving Facility Lenders in their sole discretion), such Other Revolving Loans shall have (x) substantially similar terms as the Initial Revolving Loans or (y) such other terms (including as to guarantees and collateral) as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
 
120 
 
 
(vii)            with respect to any Subject Term Loan, the All-in Yield of the Subject Term Loan shall not exceed the All-in Yield applicable to the Term B Loans on the Closing Date, except that the All-in Yield in respect of any such Subject Term Loan may exceed the All-in Yield in respect of such Term B Loans on the Closing Date by no more than 0.50%, or if it does so exceed such All-in Yield by more than 0.50% (such difference, the “Term Yield Differential”) then the Applicable Margin (or the “SOFR floor” as provided in the following proviso) applicable to such Term B Loans shall be increased such that after giving effect to such increase, the Term Yield Differential shall not exceed 0.50%; provided that, to the extent any portion of the Term Yield Differential is attributable to a higher “Term SOFR floor” being applicable to such Subject Term Loan, such floor shall only be included in the calculation of the Term Yield Differential to the extent such floor is greater than the Adjusted Term SOFR in effect for an Interest Period of three months’ duration at such time, and, with respect to such excess, the “Term SOFR floor” applicable to the outstanding Term B Loans shall be increased to an amount not to exceed the “Term SOFR floor” applicable to such Subject Term Loan prior to any increase in the Applicable Margin applicable to such Term B Loans then outstanding; provided, further, that this clause (vii) shall not be applicable to any Subject Term Loan that (A) is initially incurred under clauses (i) or (iii) under the definition of “Incremental Amount” and/or (B) has a maturity date that is at least two (2) years after the Term B Facility Maturity Date (this clause (vii), the “MFN Provision”);
 
(viii)            (A) such Other Revolving Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not a greater than pro rata basis) (and, in the case of Other Revolving Loans secured by Liens that are junior in right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Initial Revolving Loans, on a junior basis) than the Initial Revolving Loans in (x) any voluntary or mandatory prepayment or commitment reduction hereunder and (y) any Borrowing at the time such Borrowing is made and (B) such Other Term Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not a greater than pro rata basis) (and, in the case of Other Term Loans secured by Liens that are junior in right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Term B Loans, on a junior basis) than the Term B Loans in any mandatory prepayment hereunder; and
 
(ix)            (A) there shall be no obligor in respect of any Incremental Term Loan Commitments or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments that is not a Loan Party and (B) no Incremental Term Loan Commitments or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments shall be secured by any assets that do not constitute Collateral.
 
Each party hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Assumption Agreement, this Agreement and any other Loan Documents shall be amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments evidenced thereby as provided for in Section 9.08(e). Any amendment to this Agreement or any other Loan Document that is necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 2.21 and any such collateral and other documentation shall be deemed “Loan Documents” hereunder and may be memorialized in writing by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower and furnished to the other parties hereto.
 
121 
 
  
(c)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Term Loan Commitment or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment shall become effective under this Section 2.21 unless (i) on the date of such effectiveness, (A) solely to the extent required by the relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement, the conditions set forth in clause (c) of Section 4.01 shall be satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower and (B) (I) if such Incremental Term Loan Commitment or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment is established to finance any Permitted Business Acquisition or any other similar permitted Investment, no Event of Default under Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom or (II) if such Incremental Term Loan Commitment or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment is established for any other purpose, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred or be continuing or would result therefrom and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received customary legal opinions, board resolutions and other customary closing certificates and documentation to the extent required by the relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement and, to the extent required by the Administrative Agent, consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date under Section 4.02 and such additional customary documents and filings (including amendments or supplements to the Collateral Documents, as applicable, and modification endorsements, which, in the case of such amendments or supplements and modification endorsements, may be delivered on a post-closing basis to the extent permitted by the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, the relevant Collateral Documents or hereunder) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to assure that the Incremental Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Loans in respect of Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments are secured by Liens on the Collateral ratably with (or, to the extent set forth in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, junior to) one or more Classes of then-existing Term Loans and Revolving Facility Loans.
 
(d)            Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may take any and all action as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that (i) all Incremental Term Loans (other than Other Term Loans of a different Class), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of the outstanding applicable Class of Term Loans on a pro rata basis, and (ii) all Revolving Facility Loans in respect of Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments (other than Revolving Facility Loans of a different Class), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of the applicable Class of outstanding Revolving Facility Loans on a pro rata basis. The Borrower agrees that Section 2.16 shall apply to any conversion of SOFR Loans to ABR Loans reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to effect the foregoing.
 
122 
 
 
(e)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (e) through (i) of this Section 2.21), pursuant to one or more offers made from time to time by the Borrower to all Lenders of any Class of Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitments, on a pro rata basis (based, in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Class of Term Loans, on the aggregate outstanding Term Loans of such Class and, in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Revolving Facility, on the aggregate outstanding Revolving Facility Commitments under such Revolving Facility, as applicable) and on the same terms (“Pro Rata Extension Offers”), the Borrower is hereby permitted to consummate transactions with individual Lenders from time to time to extend the maturity date of such Lender’s Loans and/or Commitments of such Class and to otherwise modify the terms of such Lender’s Loans and/or Commitments of such Class pursuant to the terms of the relevant Pro Rata Extension Offer (including, without limitation, increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such Lender’s Loans and/or Commitments and/or modifying the amortization schedule in respect of such Lender’s Loans). For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to “on the same terms” in the preceding sentence shall mean, (i) in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Class of Term Loans, that all of the Term Loans of such Class are offered to be extended for the same amount of time and that the interest rate changes and fees payable with respect to such extension are the same and (ii) in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Revolving Facility, that all of the Revolving Facility Commitments of such Facility are offered to be extended for the same amount of time and that the interest rate changes and fees payable with respect to such extension are the same. Any such extension (an “Extension”) agreed to between the Borrower and any such Lender (an “Extending Lender”) will be established under this Agreement by implementing an Incremental Term Loan for such Lender if such Lender is extending an existing Term Loan (such extended Term Loan, an “Extended Term Loan”) or an Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment for such Lender if such Lender is extending an existing Revolving Facility Commitment (such extended Revolving Facility Commitment, an “Extended Revolving Facility Commitment” and any Revolving Facility Loans made thereunder, “Extended Revolving Loans”). Each Pro Rata Extension Offer shall specify the date on which the Borrower proposes that the Extended Term Loan shall be made or Extended Revolving Facility Commitment shall become effective, which shall be a date not earlier than five Business Days after the date on which notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion).

(f)            The Borrower and each Extending Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments of such Extending Lender. Each Incremental Assumption Agreement shall specify the terms of the applicable Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments; provided, that (i) except as to interest rates, fees and any other pricing terms (which interest rates, fees and other pricing terms shall not be subject to the provisions set forth in Section 2.21(b)(vii)), and amortization, final maturity date and participation in prepayments and commitment reductions (which shall, subject to clauses (ii) and (iii) of this proviso, be determined by the Borrower and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer), the Extended Term Loans shall have (x) the same terms as an existing Class of Term Loans or (y) such other terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (ii) the final maturity date of any Extended Term Loans shall be no earlier than the latest Term Facility Maturity Date in effect on the date of incurrence, (iii) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Extended Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Class of Term Loans to which such offer relates, (iv) except as to interest rates, fees, any other pricing terms, participation in mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions and final maturity (which shall be determined by the Borrower and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer), any Extended Revolving Facility Commitment shall have (x) the same terms as an existing Class of Revolving Facility Commitments or (y) have such other terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and, in respect of any other terms that would affect the rights or duties of any Issuing Bank, such terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank, (v) any Extended Revolving Facility Commitments may participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not greater than a pro rata basis) than the Initial Revolving Loans in any voluntary or mandatory prepayment or commitment reduction hereunder and (vi) any Extended Term Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not a greater than pro rata basis) than the Term B Loans in any mandatory prepayment hereunder. Upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Assumption Agreement, this Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments evidenced thereby as provided for in Section 9.08(e). Any such deemed amendment may be memorialized in writing by the Administrative Agent with the Borrower’s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and furnished to the other parties hereto. If provided in any Incremental Assumption Agreement with respect to any Extended Revolving Facility Commitments, and with the consent of each Issuing Bank, participations in Letters of Credit shall be reallocated to lenders holding such Extended Revolving Facility Commitments in the manner specified in such Incremental Assumption Agreement, including upon effectiveness of such Extended Revolving Facility Commitment or upon or prior to the maturity date for any Class of Revolving Facility Commitments.
 
124 
 
 
(g)            Upon the effectiveness of any such Extension, the applicable Extending Lender’s Term Loan will be automatically designated an Extended Term Loan and/or such Extending Lender’s Revolving Facility Commitment will be automatically designated an Extended Revolving Facility Commitment. For purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (i) if such Extending Lender is extending a Term Loan, such Extending Lender will be deemed to have an Incremental Term Loan having the terms of such Extended Term Loan and (ii) if such Extending Lender is extending a Revolving Facility Commitment, such Extending Lender will be deemed to have an Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment having the terms of such Extended Revolving Facility Commitment.
 
(h)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including, without limitation, this Section 2.21), (i) the aggregate amount of Extended Term Loans and Extended Revolving Facility Commitments will not be included in the calculation of the Incremental Amount, (ii) no Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving Facility Commitment is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment, (iii) any Extending Lender may extend all or any portion of its Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitment pursuant to one or more Pro Rata Extension Offers (subject to applicable proration in the case of over participation) (including the extension of any Extended Term Loan and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitment), (iv) there shall be no condition to any Extension of any Loan or Commitment at any time or from time to time other than notice to the Administrative Agent of such Extension and the terms of the Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving Facility Commitment implemented thereby, (v) all Extended Term Loans, Extended Revolving Facility Commitments and all obligations in respect thereof shall be Loan Obligations of the relevant Loan Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are secured by Liens on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with all other Obligations relating to an existing Class of Term Loans of the relevant Loan Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (vi) no Issuing Bank shall be obligated to issue Letters of Credit under such Extended Revolving Facility Commitments unless it shall have consented thereto and (vii) there shall be no obligor in respect of any such Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments that is not a Loan Party.
 
125 
 
  
(i)            Each Extension shall be consummated pursuant to procedures set forth in the associated Pro Rata Extension Offer; provided, that the Borrower shall cooperate with the Administrative Agent prior to making any Pro Rata Extension Offer to establish reasonable procedures with respect to mechanical provisions relating to such Extension, including, without limitation, timing, rounding and other adjustments.
 
(j)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (j) through (o) of this Section 2.21), the Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent establish one or more additional tranches of term loans under this Agreement (such loans, “Refinancing Term Loans”), which are used to Refinance in whole or in part any Class of Term Loans. Each such notice shall specify the date (each, a “Refinancing Effective Date”) on which the Borrower proposes that the Refinancing Term Loans shall be made, which shall be a date not earlier than five Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion); provided, that:
 
(i)            before and after giving effect to the Borrowing of such Refinancing Term Loans on the Refinancing Effective Date each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall be satisfied to the extent required by the relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement governing such Refinancing Term Loans;
 
(ii)            the final maturity date of the Refinancing Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Term Facility Maturity Date of the refinanced Term Loans;
 
(iii)            the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Refinancing Term Loans shall be no shorter than the then-remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the refinanced Term Loans;
 
(iv)            the aggregate principal amount of the Refinancing Term Loans shall not exceed the outstanding principal amount of the refinanced Term Loans plus amounts used to pay fees, premiums, costs and expenses (including original issue discount) and accrued interest associated therewith;
 
(v)            all other terms applicable to such Refinancing Term Loans (other than provisions relating to original issue discount, upfront fees, interest rates and any other pricing terms (which original issue discount, upfront fees, interest rates and other pricing terms shall not be subject to the provisions set forth in Section 2.21(b)(vii)), final maturity date, amortization and optional prepayment or mandatory prepayment or redemption terms, which shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders providing such Refinancing Term Loans) taken as a whole shall be substantially similar to, or not materially less favorable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries than, the terms, taken as a whole, applicable to the Term B Loans (except to the extent such covenants and other terms apply solely to any period after the Term B Facility Maturity Date or are otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent), as determined by the Borrower in good faith; and
 
126 
 
 
(vi)            there shall be no obligor in respect of such Refinancing Term Loans that is not a Loan Party.
 
In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may establish Refinancing Term Loans to refinance and/or replace all or any portion of a Revolving Facility Commitment (regardless of whether Revolving Facility Loans are outstanding under such Revolving Facility Commitments at the time of incurrence of such Refinancing Term Loans), so long as (1) the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Term Loans does not exceed the aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Commitments terminated at the time of incurrence thereof plus amounts used to pay fees, premiums, costs and expenses (including original issue discount) and accrued interest associated therewith, (2) if the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure outstanding on the Refinancing Effective Date would exceed the aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Commitments outstanding in each case after giving effect to the termination of such Revolving Facility Commitments, the Borrower shall take one or more actions such that such Revolving Facility Credit Exposure does not exceed such aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Commitments in effect on the Refinancing Effective Date after giving effect to the termination of such Revolving Facility Commitments (it being understood that (x) such Refinancing Term Loans may be provided by the Lenders holding the Revolving Facility Commitments being terminated and/or by any other person that would be a permitted Assignee hereunder and (y) the proceeds of such Refinancing Term Loans shall not constitute Net Proceeds hereunder), (3) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Refinancing Term Loans (disregarding any customary amortization for this purpose) shall be no shorter than the remaining life to termination of the terminated Revolving Facility Commitments, (4) the final maturity date of the Refinancing Term Loans shall be no earlier than the termination date of the terminated Revolving Facility Commitments, and (5) all other terms applicable to such Refinancing Term Loans (other than provisions relating to original issue discount, upfront fees, interest rates and any other pricing terms (which original issue discount, upfront fees, interest rates and other pricing terms shall not be subject to the provisions set forth in Section 2.21(b)(vii)), final maturity date, amortization and optional prepayment or mandatory prepayment or redemption terms, which shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders providing such Refinancing Term Loans) taken as a whole shall be substantially similar to, or not materially less favorable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries than, the terms, taken as a whole, applicable to the Term B Loans (except to the extent such covenants and other terms apply solely to any period after the Term B Facility Maturity Date or are otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent), as determined by the Borrower in good faith.
 
127 
 
 
  
(k)            The Borrower may approach any Lender or any other person that would be a permitted Assignee pursuant to Section 9.04 to provide all or a portion of the Refinancing Term Loans; provided, that any Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of the Refinancing Term Loans may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a Refinancing Term Loan. Any Refinancing Term Loans made on any Refinancing Effective Date shall be designated an additional Class of Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement; provided, further, that any Refinancing Term Loans may, to the extent provided in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement governing such Refinancing Term Loans, be designated as an increase in any previously established Class of Term Loans made to the Borrower.
  
(l)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (l) through (o) of this Section 2.21), the Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent establish one or more additional Facilities providing for revolving commitments (“Replacement Revolving Facilities” and the commitments thereunder, “Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments” and the revolving loans thereunder, “Replacement Revolving Loans”), which replace in whole or in part any Class of Revolving Facility Commitments under this Agreement. Each such notice shall specify the date (each, a “Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date”) on which the Borrower proposes that the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall become effective, which shall be a date not less than five Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion); provided that: (i) before and after giving effect to the establishment of such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments on the Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date, each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall be satisfied to the extent required by the relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement governing such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments; (ii) after giving effect to the establishment of any Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and any concurrent reduction in the aggregate amount of any other Revolving Facility Commitments, the aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Commitments shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Facility Commitments outstanding immediately prior to the applicable Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date; (iii) no Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall have a final maturity date (or require commitment reductions or amortization) prior to the Revolving Facility Maturity Date in effect at the time of incurrence for the Revolving Facility Commitments being replaced; (iv) all other terms applicable to such Replacement Revolving Facility (other than provisions relating to (x) fees, interest rates and other pricing terms, final maturity date and prepayment and commitment reduction and optional redemption terms which shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders providing such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and (y) the amount of any letter of credit sublimit under such Replacement Revolving Facility, which shall be as agreed between the Borrower, the Lenders providing such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments, the Administrative Agent and the replacement issuing bank, if any, under such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments) taken as a whole shall be substantially similar to, or not materially less favorable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries than, the terms, taken as a whole, applicable to the Initial Revolving Loans (except to the extent such covenants and other terms apply solely to any period after the latest Revolving Facility Maturity Date in effect at the time of incurrence or are otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent), as determined by the Borrower in good faith; and (v) there shall be no obligor in respect of such Replacement Revolving Facility that is not a Loan Party. In addition, the Borrower may establish Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments to refinance and/or replace all or any portion of a Term Loan hereunder (regardless of whether such Term Loan is repaid with the proceeds of Replacement Revolving Loans or otherwise), so long as (1) the aggregate amount of such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans repaid at the time of establishment thereof (it being understood that such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment may be provided by the Lenders holding the Term Loans being repaid and/or by any other person that would be a permitted Assignee hereunder), (2) before and after giving effect to the establishment such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments on the Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall be satisfied to the extent required by the relevant agreement governing such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments, (3) the remaining life to termination of such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall be no shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity then applicable to the refinanced Term Loans, (4) the final termination date of the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall be no earlier than the Term Facility Maturity Date of the refinanced Term Loans, (5) with respect to Replacement Revolving Loans secured by Liens on the Collateral that rank junior in right of security to the Initial Revolving Loans, such Liens will be subject to a Permitted Junior Intercreditor Agreement and (6) there shall be no obligor in respect of such Replacement Revolving Facility that is not a Loan Party. Solely to the extent that an Issuing Bank is not a replacement issuing bank under a Replacement Revolving Facility, it is understood and agreed that such Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue any letters of credit under such Replacement Revolving Facility and, to the extent it is necessary for such Issuing Bank to withdraw as an Issuing Bank at the time of the establishment of such Replacement Revolving Facility, such withdrawal shall be on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank in its sole discretion. The Borrower agrees to reimburse each Issuing Bank in full upon demand, for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket cost or expense attributable to such withdrawal.
 
128 
 
  
(m)            The Borrower may approach any Lender or any other person that would be a permitted Assignee of a Revolving Facility Commitment pursuant to Section 9.04 to provide all or a portion of the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments; provided that any Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment. Any Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment made on any Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date shall be designated an additional Class of Revolving Facility Commitments for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that any Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments may, to the extent provided in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, be designated as an increase in any previously established Class of Revolving Facility Commitments.
 
(n)            On any Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, each of the Lenders with Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class shall purchase from each of the other Lenders with Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class, at the principal amount thereof and in the applicable currencies, such interests in the Replacement Revolving Loans and participations in Letters of Credit under such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class then outstanding on such Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date as shall be necessary in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, the Replacement Revolving Loans and participations of such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class will be held by the Lenders thereunder ratably in accordance with their Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments.
 
129 
 
  
(o)            For purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (i) if a Lender is providing a Refinancing Term Loan, such Lender will be deemed to have an Incremental Term Loan having the terms of such Refinancing Term Loan and (ii) if a Lender is providing a Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment, such Lender will be deemed to have an Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment having the terms of such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including, without limitation, this Section 2.21), (i) the aggregate amount of Refinancing Term Loans and Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments will not be included in the calculation of the Incremental Amount, (ii) no Refinancing Term Loan or Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment, (iii) there shall be no condition to any incurrence of any Refinancing Term Loan or Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment at any time or from time to time other than those set forth in clauses (j) or (l) above, as applicable, and (iv) all Refinancing Term Loans, Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and all obligations in respect thereof shall be Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are secured by Liens on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with or, at the Borrower’s option, junior to all other Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
(p)            Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (i) for the purpose of determining the number of outstanding SOFR Borrowings upon the incurrence of any Incremental Loans, (x) to the extent the last date of Interest Periods for multiple SOFR Borrowings under the Term Facilities fall on the same day, such SOFR Borrowings shall be considered a single SOFR Borrowing, as applicable, and (y) to the extent the last date of Interest Periods for multiple SOFR Borrowings under the Revolving Facilities fall on the same day, such SOFR Borrowings shall be considered a single SOFR Borrowing and (ii) the initial Interest Period with respect to any SOFR Borrowing of Incremental Loans may, at the Borrower’s option, be of a duration that is not specified in the definition of “Interest Period” to correspond to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date applicable to any then-outstanding SOFR Borrowing, and Adjusted Term SOFR with respect to such initial Interest Period shall be the same as Adjusted Term SOFR applicable to any then-outstanding SOFR Borrowing as the Borrower may direct, so long as the last day of such initial Interest Period is the same as the last day of the Interest Period with respect to such outstanding SOFR Borrowing.

 
Section 3.24      Senior Debt. The Loan Obligations constitute “Senior Class Debt” under, and as defined in, the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and “Senior Debt” (or the equivalent thereof) under the documentation governing any Material Indebtedness of any Loan Party permitted to be incurred hereunder constituting Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Loan Obligations.

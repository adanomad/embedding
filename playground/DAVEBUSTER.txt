the consummation of the Transactions, or in the case of notice given in respect of Incremental Commitments, which may be conditioned as
provided in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement). Each such written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in

of such Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into
by the Borrower with, an Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, (i) any Letter of Credit issued for the account of an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall only be permitted to the
extent of the Borrower’s ability to make an Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary pursuant to Section 6.04 and (ii) any Letter of Credit issued
for the account of Holdings shall only be permitted to the extent of the Borrower’s ability to make a Restricted Payment to Holdings pursuant to
Section 6.06.

(b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension: Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal (other than an automatic extension in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 2.05) or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit),
the Borrower shall hand deliver or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable
Issuing Bank, to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (at least three Business Days in advance of the requested date of
issuance, amendment or extension or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank in their sole discretion may
agree) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended or extended, and specifying the date
of issuance, amendment or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with
paragraph (c) of this Section 2.05), the amount and currency (which shall be Dollars or Canadian Dollars) of such Letter of Credit, the name and
address of the beneficiary thereof, whether such Letter of Credit constitutes a Standby Letter of Credit or a Trade Letter of Credit and such other
information as shall be necessary to issue, amend or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower also
shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of
Credit shall be issued, amended or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be
deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment or extension, (i) the aggregate Revolving Facility Credit
Exposure of the applicable Class shall not exceed the aggregate Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class and (ii) the Revolving L/C Exposure
<PAGE 38 >
shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. No Issuing Bank shall be required to issue a Letter of Credit if the aggregate amount of Letters of
Credit issued by such Issuing Bank would exceed its Letter of Credit Commitment; provided, that Bank of America, N.A., as issuer of the Existing
Letters of Credit, agrees that the Existing Letters of Credit may exceed its Letter of Credit Commitment.
(c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date that is one year (unless
otherwise agreed upon by the Borrower and the applicable Issuing Bank in their sole discretion) after the date of the issuance of such Letter of
Credit (or, in the case of any extension thereof, one year (unless otherwise agreed upon by the Borrower and the applicable Issuing Bank in their
sole discretion) after such extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Extended Revolving Facility Maturity Date; provided,
that any Letter of Credit with a one year tenor may provide for automatic extension thereof for additional one year periods (which, in no event, shall
extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) of this paragraph (c)) so long as such Letter of Credit permits the applicable Issuing Bank to
prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving
prior notice to the beneficiary thereof within a time period during such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is
issued; provided, further, that if such Issuing Bank consents in its sole discretion, the expiration date on any Letter of Credit may extend beyond
the date referred to in clause (ii) above, provided, that if any such Letter of Credit is outstanding or is issued under the Revolving Facility
Commitments of any Class after the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Facility Maturity Date for such Class the Borrower shall
provide Cash Collateral pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the relevant Issuing Bank in an
amount equal to the face amount of each such Letter of Credit on or prior to the date that is five Business Days prior to such Revolving Facility
Maturity Date or, if later, such date of issuance.
91
(d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) under the Revolving
Facility Commitments of any Class and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Revolving Facility Lenders,
such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Facility Lender under such Class, and each such Revolving Facility Lender hereby acquires
from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Facility Lender’s applicable Revolving Facility Percentage
of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving
Facility Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, in
Dollars, such Revolving Facility Lender’s applicable Revolving Facility Percentage of each L/C Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not
reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05, or of any reimbursement payment required to be
refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Facility Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations
pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including any amendment or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments or the fact that, as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, such Revolving Facility Lender’s Revolving
Facility Credit Exposure at any time might exceed its Revolving Facility Commitment at such time (in which case Section 2.11(f) would apply), and
that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
(e) Reimbursement. If the applicable Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse
such L/C Disbursement (in the case of any L/C Disbursement in Canadian Dollars, taking the Dollar Equivalent thereof) by paying to the
Administrative Agent an amount in Dollars equal to such L/C Disbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the first Business Day after the
Borrower receives notice under paragraph (g) of this Section 2.05 of such L/C Disbursement (or the second Business Day, if such notice is received
after 12:00 noon, Local Time), together with accrued interest thereon from the date of such L/C Disbursement at the rate applicable to ABR
Revolving Facility Loans of the applicable Class; provided, that the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested in accordance with Section 2.03
(other than with respect to delivering a Borrowing Request or the satisfaction of any other conditions to borrowing) that such payment be financed
with an ABR Revolving Facility Borrowing of the applicable Class, as applicable, in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the
Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Facility Borrowing. If the Borrower
fails to reimburse any L/C Disbursement when due, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Issuing Bank and each other
applicable Revolving Facility Lender of the applicable L/C Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof (in the case of
any L/C Disbursement made in Canadian Dollars, taking the Dollar Equivalent thereof) (the “Unreimbursed Amount”) and, in the case of a
Revolving Facility Lender, such Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Facility
Lender with a Revolving Facility Commitment of the applicable Class shall pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars its Revolving Facility
Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section
2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Facility Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay
to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Facility Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative
Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable
Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Facility Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank,
then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any L/C Disbursement (other than the funding of an ABR Revolving Loan as contemplated above) shall
not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such L/C Disbursement.
92
(f) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05 shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all
circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or
provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or
any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against
presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower’s obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any
Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of
any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding
sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating
to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any
consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank, or any of the circumstances referred to in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the
first sentence; provided, that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the applicable Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent
<PAGE 39 >
of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted
by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are determined by final and binding decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have been
caused by such Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit
comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
applicable Issuing Bank, such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and
without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to be in substantial
compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such
documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make
payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
(g) Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by
telephone (confirmed by electronic means) of any such demand for payment under a Letter of Credit and whether such Issuing Bank has made or
will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided, that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its
obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Facility Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement.
(h) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement in full
on the date such L/C Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such L/C
Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such L/C Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR
Revolving Loans of the applicable Class; provided, that, if such L/C Disbursement is not reimbursed by the Borrower when due pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section 2.05, then Section 2.13(e) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Facility Lender pursuant to paragraph (e)
of this Section 2.05 to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Facility Lender to the extent of such payment.
93
(i) Replacement of an Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of
an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the
replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12. From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall
have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and
(ii) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor
and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall
remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of such Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of
Credit issued by it prior to such replacement but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
(j) Cash Collateralization Following Certain Events. If and when the Borrower is required to Cash Collateralize any Revolving L/C Exposure relating
to any outstanding Letters of Credit pursuant to any of Section 2.05(c), 2.11(e), 2.11(f), 2.11(g), 2.22(a)(v) or 7.01, the Borrower shall deposit in an
account with or at the direction of the Collateral Agent, in the name of the Collateral Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Facility Lenders, an
amount in cash in Dollars equal to the Revolving L/C Exposure as of such date (or, in the case of Sections 2.05(c), 2.11(e), 2.11(f), 2.11(g) and 2.22(a)
(v), the portion thereof required by such Sections). Each deposit of Cash Collateral (x) made pursuant to this paragraph or (y) made by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.22(a)(ii), in each case, shall be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the payment and
performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including
the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall
be made at the option and sole discretion of (i) for so long as an Event of Default shall be continuing, the Collateral Agent and (ii) at any other time,
the Borrower, in each case, in Permitted Investments and at the risk and expense of the Borrower, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or
profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Collateral Agent to
reimburse each Issuing Bank for L/C Disbursements for which such Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall
be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the Revolving L/C Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the
Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with Revolving L/C Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total
Revolving L/C Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an
amount of Cash Collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default or the existence of a Defaulting Lender or the occurrence
of a limit under Section 2.11(e), (f) or (g) being exceeded, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower
within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived or the termination of the Defaulting Lender status or the limits
under Sections 2.11(e), (f) and (g) no longer being exceeded, as applicable.
94
(k) Cash Collateralization Following Termination of the Revolving Facility. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event of the
prepayment in full of all outstanding Revolving Facility Loans and the termination of all Revolving Facility Commitments (a “Revolving Facility
Termination Event”) in connection with which the Borrower notifies any one or more Issuing Banks that it intends to maintain one or more Letters
of Credit initially issued under this Agreement in effect after the date of such Revolving Facility Termination Event (each, a “Continuing Letter of
Credit”), then the security interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral under the Collateral Documents may be terminated in accordance with
Section 9.18 if each such Continuing Letter of Credit is Cash Collateralized in an amount equal to the Minimum L/C Collateral Amount, which shall
be deposited with or at the direction of each such Issuing Bank or other arrangements acceptable to each such Issuing Bank have been made.
(l) Additional Issuing Banks. From time to time, the Borrower may by notice to the Administrative Agent designate any Lender (in addition to the
initial Issuing Banks) each of which agrees (in its sole discretion) to act in such capacity and is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
as an Issuing Bank. Each such additional Issuing Bank shall execute a counterpart of this Agreement upon the approval of the Administrative
Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall thereafter be an Issuing Bank hereunder for all purposes.
(m) Reporting. Unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall (i) provide to the Administrative Agent copies of
any notice received from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.05(b) no later than the next Business Day after receipt thereof and (ii) report in writing
to the Administrative Agent (A) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank expects to issue, amend or extend any Letter of
Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment or extension, the currency in which a Letter of Credit is denominated and the aggregate face amount
of the Letters of Credit to be issued, amended or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment or extension
occurred (and whether the amount thereof changed), and such Issuing Bank shall be permitted to issue, amend or extend such Letter of Credit if the
Administrative Agent shall not have advised such Issuing Bank that such issuance, amendment or extension would not be in conformity with the
<PAGE 40 >
requirements of this Agreement, (B) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any L/C Disbursement, the date of such L/C
Disbursement and the amount of such L/C Disbursement (using the Dollar Equivalent of any L/C Disbursement made in Canadian Dollars) and (C)
on any other Business Day, such other information with respect to the outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank as the
Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.
(n) Applicability of ISP and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the relevant Issuing Bank and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is
issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Standby Letter of Credit.
95
(o) Acquired Letters of Credit. On each Acquisition Closing Date, each applicable Acquired Letter of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued as
a Letter of Credit under this Agreement by the applicable Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be deemed, without further action by any party
hereto, to have granted to each of the Lenders, and each Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have acquired from
such Issuing Bank, a participation (on the terms specified in this Section 2.05) in such Acquired Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s Revolving
Facility Percentage thereof. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Acquired Letters of Credit
pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Facility Commitments, and that each payment by a Lender in respect of such
participations shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
(p) Replacement of Existing Letters of Credit. Within 90 days of the Closing Date (or such later date as agreed by Bank of America, N.A., as the
issuer of the Existing Letters of Credit), the Borrower agrees to replace the Existing Letters of Credit with Letters of Credit issued by other Issuing
Banks hereunder.
Section 2.06 Funding of Borrowings.
(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by
2:00 p.m., Local Time (or, if applicable, in the case of Loans made on the Closing Date, 8:30 a.m., Local Time), to the account of the Administrative
Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account or accounts designated by the Borrower as specified in the
applicable Borrowing Request; provided, that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of a L/C Disbursement and
reimbursements as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has
made such share available on such date in accordance with clause (a) of this Section 2.06 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the Borrowing available to the
Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand
(without duplication) such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to
the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the
greater of (A) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (B) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans at such time. If the
Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be
without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
96
(c) The foregoing notwithstanding, the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, may from its own funds make a Revolving Facility Loan on
behalf of the Lenders. In such event, the applicable Lenders on behalf of whom the Administrative Agent made the Revolving Facility Loan shall
reimburse the Administrative Agent for all or any portion of such Revolving Facility Loan made on its behalf upon written notice given to each
applicable Lender not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the Business Day such reimbursement is requested. The entire amount of interest
attributable to such Revolving Facility Loan for the period from and including the date on which such Revolving Facility Loan was made on such
Lender’s behalf to but excluding the date the Administrative Agent is reimbursed in respect of such Revolving Facility Loan by such Lender shall
be paid to the Administrative Agent for its own account.
Section 2.07 Interest Elections.
(a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a SOFR Borrowing, shall have an
initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or
to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a SOFR Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.07. The
Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated
ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a
separate Borrowing.
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.07, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to
be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or electronic means to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower.
(c) Each written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the principal amount of Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with
respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be
specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
97
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a SOFR Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a SOFR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which
shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period.”
If any such Interest Election Request requests a SOFR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to
<PAGE 41 >
have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration. If less than all the outstanding principal amount of any Borrowing shall be converted or
continued, then each resulting Borrowing shall be in an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum and
satisfy the limitations specified in Sections 2.02(c) regarding the maximum number of Borrowings of the relevant Type.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender to which such Interest Election
Request relates of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a SOFR Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted
to, with respect to SOFR Borrowings, an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the written request (including a request through electronic means) of the Required Lenders, so
notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a SOFR
Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each SOFR Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto.
Section 2.08 Termination and Reduction of Commitments.
(a) Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Facility Commitments of each Class shall terminate on the applicable Revolving Facility Maturity
Date for such Class. On the Closing Date (after giving effect to the funding of the Term B Loans to be made on such date), the Term B Loan
Commitments of each Lender as of the Closing Date will terminate.
(b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class; provided, that (i) each
reduction of the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $250,000 and not less than
$1,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining amount of the Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class) and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce
the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Facility Loans in accordance
with Section 2.11 and any Cash Collateralization of Letters of Credit in accordance with Section 2.05(j) or (k), the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure
of such Class (excluding any Cash Collateralized Letter of Credit) would exceed the total Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class.
98
(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class
under paragraph (b) of this Section 2.08 at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction (or such shorter
period reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent), specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of
any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant
to this Section 2.08 shall be irrevocable; provided, that a notice of termination or reduction of the Revolving Facility Commitments of any Class
delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, indentures or similar
agreements or other transactions, in which case such notice may be delayed until such time as such condition is satisfied or revoked by the
Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied (or waived by the
Borrower in its sole discretion) and/or rescinded at any time by the Borrower if the Borrower determines in its sole discretion that any or all of such
conditions will not be satisfied (or waived). Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the
Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class.
(d) The Term Commitment of the Term B Lenders shall be automatically and permanently reduced to $0 upon the funding of the Term B Loans to be
made by it on the Closing Date.
Section 2.09 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.
(a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Facility Lender the
then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Facility Loan to the Borrower on the Revolving Facility Maturity Date applicable to such
Revolving Facility Loans and (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Term Loan
of such Lender as provided in Section 2.10.
(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time
to time hereunder.
(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Facility and Type
thereof and the Interest Period (if any) applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable
from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) any amount received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders
and each Lender’s share thereof.
99
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of this Section 2.09 shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any
error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note (a “Note”). In such event, the Borrower shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and
in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Borrower. Thereafter, unless otherwise agreed to by the
applicable Lender, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be
represented by one or more Notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if requested by such payee, to such payee and its
registered assigns).
Section 2.10 Repayment of Term Loans and Revolving Facility Loans.
(a) Subject to the other clauses of this Section 2.10 and to Section 9.08(e),
(i) the Borrower shall repay Term B Loans incurred on the last day of each January, April, July and October of each year (commencing on
October 31, 2022) and on the applicable Term Facility Maturity Date or, if any such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding
Business Day (each such date being referred to as a “Term B Loan Installment Date”), in an aggregate principal amount of such Term B
Loans equal to (A) in the case of quarterly payments due prior to the applicable Term Facility Maturity Date, an amount equal to 0.25% of
the aggregate principal amount of such Term B Loans outstanding immediately after the Closing Date, and (B) in the case of such payment
due on the applicable Term Facility Maturity Date, an amount equal to the then unpaid principal amount of such Term B Loans
outstanding;
(ii) in the event that any Incremental Term Loans are made, the Borrower shall repay such Incremental Term Loans on the dates and in the
amounts set forth in the related Incremental Assumption Agreement (each such date being referred to as an “Incremental Term Loan
<PAGE 42 >
Installment Date”); and
(iii) to the extent not previously paid, outstanding Term Loans shall be due and payable on the applicable Term Facility Maturity Date.
(b) To the extent not previously paid, outstanding Revolving Facility Loans shall be due and payable on the applicable Revolving Facility Maturity
Date.
(c) Prepayment of the Loans from:
(i) all Net Proceeds pursuant to Section 2.11(b) and Excess Cash Flow pursuant to Section 2.11(c)(i) shall be allocated to the Class or
Classes of Term Loans determined pursuant to Section 2.10(d), with the application thereof to reduce in direct order amounts due on the
succeeding Term Loan Installment Dates under such Classes as provided in the remaining scheduled amortization payments under such
Classes; provided, that any Lender, at its option, may elect to decline any such prepayment (other than a prepayment with Net Proceeds of
Indebtedness pursuant to Section 2.11(b)) of any Term Loan held by it if it shall give written notice to the Administrative Agent thereof by
5:00 p.m. Local Time at least three Business Days prior to the date of such prepayment (any such Lender, a “Declining Lender”) and on the
date of any such prepayment, any amounts that would otherwise have been applied to prepay Term Loans owing to Declining Lenders
(such amounts, the “Declined Proceeds”) shall instead be retained by the Borrower for application for any purpose not prohibited by this
Agreement, and
100
(ii) any optional prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(a) shall be applied to the remaining installments of the Term
Loans under the applicable Class or Classes as the Borrower may in each case direct.
(d) Any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or (c) shall be applied so that the aggregate amount of such prepayment
is allocated among the Term B Loans and the Other Term Loans, if any, pro rata based on the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Term B
Loans and Other Term Loans, if any; provided, that, subject to the pro rata application to Loans outstanding within any Class of Term Loans, the
Borrower may allocate such prepayment in its discretion among the Class or Classes of Term Loans as the Borrower may specify (so long as such
allocation complies with Section 2.21(b) or Section 2.21(f), as applicable). Prior to any prepayment of any Loan under any Facility hereunder, the
Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings under the applicable Facility to be prepaid and shall notify the Administrative Agent of such
selection not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, (i) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, at least one Business Day before the scheduled date of such
prepayment and (ii) in the case of a SOFR Borrowing, at least three Business Days before the scheduled date of such prepayment (or, in each case,
such shorter period reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent); provided, that a notice of prepayment may state that such notice is
conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, indentures or similar agreements or other transactions, in which case such notice may
be delayed until such time as such condition is satisfied or revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the
specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied (or waived by the Borrower in its sole discretion) and/or rescinded at any time by the
Borrower if the Borrower determines in its sole discretion that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied (or waived). Each repayment of a
Borrowing (x) in the case of the Revolving Facility of any Class, shall be applied to the Revolving Facility Loans included in the repaid Borrowing
such that each Revolving Facility Lender receives its ratable share of such repayment (based upon the respective Revolving Facility Credit
Exposures of the Revolving Facility Lenders of such Class at the time of such repayment) and (y) in all other cases, shall be applied ratably to the
Loans included in the repaid Borrowing. All repayments of Loans shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid to the extent
required by Section 2.13(f).
101
Section 2.11 Prepayment of Loans.
(a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Loan in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (but
subject to Section 2.12(d) and Section 2.16), in an aggregate principal amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less
than the Borrowing Minimum or, if less, the amount outstanding, subject to prior notice in accordance with Section 2.10(d).
(b) The Borrower shall apply all Net Proceeds promptly upon receipt thereof to prepay Term Loans in accordance with clauses (c) and (d) of Section
2.10. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may use a portion of such Net Proceeds to prepay, redeem or repurchase any Other First Lien
Debt, in each case in an amount not to exceed the product of (x) the amount of such Net Proceeds and (y) a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is
the outstanding principal amount of such Other First Lien Debt and (B) the denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount of
such Other First Lien Debt and the outstanding principal amount of all Classes of Term Loans.
(c) Not later than 5 Business Days after the date on which the annual financial statements are, or are required to be, delivered under Section 5.04(a)
with respect to each Excess Cash Flow Period, the Borrower shall calculate Excess Cash Flow for such Excess Cash Flow Period and the Borrower
shall apply an amount equal to (i) the amount by which the Required Percentage of such Excess Cash Flow exceeds $10,000,000 (the “ECF
Threshold Amount”) minus (ii) to the extent not financed using the proceeds of the incurrence of funded term Indebtedness, the sum of (A) the
amount of any voluntary payments, repurchases, redemptions or retirements during such Excess Cash Flow Period (plus, without duplication of
any amounts previously deducted under this clause (A), the amount of any voluntary payments, repurchases, redemptions or retirements after the
end of such Excess Cash Flow Period but before the date of prepayment under this clause (c)) of (x) Term Loans (it being understood that the
amount of any such payment constituting a below-par Permitted Loan Purchase shall be calculated to equal the amount of cash used and not the
principal amount deemed prepaid therewith) and (y) Other First Lien Debt (provided that (i) in the case of the prepayment of any revolving
Indebtedness, there was a corresponding reduction in commitments or borrowing base and (ii) the maximum amount of each such prepayment,
repurchase, redemption or retirement of Other First Lien Debt that may be counted for purposes of this clause (A)(y) shall not exceed the amount
that would have been prepaid, repurchased, redeemed or retired in respect of such Other First Lien Debt if such prepayment, repurchase,
redemption or retirement had been applied on a ratable basis among the Term Loans and such Other First Lien Debt (determined based on the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term Loans and the aggregate principal amount of such Other First Lien Debt on the date of such
prepayment, repurchase, redemption or retirement of such Other First Lien Debt)) and (B) the amount of any permanent voluntary reductions during
such Excess Cash Flow Period (plus, without duplication of any amounts previously deducted under this clause (B), the amount of any permanent
voluntary reductions after the end of such Excess Cash Flow Period but before the date of prepayment under this clause (c)) of Revolving Facility
Commitments to the extent that an equal amount of Revolving Facility Loans was simultaneously repaid (I) to prepay Term Loans in accordance
with clauses (c) and (d) of Section 2.10 or (II) to prepay Term Loans in accordance with clauses (c) and (d) of Section 2.10 and to prepay,
repurchase, redeem or retire any Other First Lien Debt so long as the prepayments under this clause (II) are applied in a manner such that the Term
Loans are prepaid on at least a ratable basis with such Other First Lien Debt (determined based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
Term Loans and the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Other First Lien Debt on the date of such prepayment, repurchase, redemption
or retirement). Such calculation will be set forth in a certificate signed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower delivered to the Administrative Agent
setting forth the amount, if any, of Excess Cash Flow for each Excess Cash Flow Period, the amount of any required prepayment in respect thereof
<PAGE 43 >
and the calculation thereof in reasonable detail.
102
(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 2.11 to the contrary, (i) to the extent that any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale
by a Foreign Subsidiary or Excess Cash Flow attributable to a Foreign Subsidiary would otherwise be required to be applied pursuant to Section
2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c) but is prohibited, restricted or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States of America (as
determined by the Borrower in good faith), an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected will not be
required to be applied to repay Term Loans or Other First Lien Debt at the times provided in Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c) and (ii) to the extent
that the Borrower has determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all of such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow that would otherwise be
required to be applied pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c) would have a material adverse tax consequence to the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries, an amount equal to the Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans or Other
First Lien Debt at the times provided in Section 2.11(b) or Section 2.11(c) (the Borrower hereby agreeing to cause the applicable Subsidiary to
promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions within the reasonable control of the Borrower that are reasonably required to
eliminate such tax effects).
(e) In the event that the aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Credit Exposure of any Class exceeds the total Revolving Facility Commitments of
such Class (other than as a result of changes in currency exchange rates), the Borrower shall prepay Revolving Facility Borrowings of such Class
(or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding, provide Cash Collateral in respect of outstanding Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) in an
aggregate amount equal to such excess.
(f) In the event that the Revolving L/C Exposure exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit (other than as a result of changes in currency exchange rates),
at the request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall provide Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.05(j) in an aggregate amount equal to
such excess.
(g) If as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, on any Revaluation Date, (i) the total Revolving Facility Credit Exposure of any Class
exceeds the total Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class or (ii) the Revolving L/C Exposure exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the
Borrower shall, at the request of the Administrative Agent, within ten days of such Revaluation Date (A) prepay Revolving Facility Borrowings or
(B) provide Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.05(j), in an aggregate amount such that the applicable exposure does not exceed the applicable
commitment sublimit or the Letter of Credit Sublimit.
103
Section 2.12 Fees.
(a) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender), through the Administrative Agent, on the date that is three
Business Days after the last day of January, April, July and October in each year and on the date on which the Revolving Facility Commitments of
all the Lenders shall be terminated as provided herein, a commitment fee (a “Commitment Fee”) on the daily amount of the applicable Available
Unused Commitment of such Lender during the preceding quarter (or other period commencing with the Closing Date or ending with the date on
which the last of the Commitments of such Lender shall be terminated) at a rate equal to the Applicable Margin accrued up to the last Business Day
of each January, April, July and October (or such date on which the Commitments of all Lenders are terminated). All Commitment Fees shall be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. The Commitment Fee due to each Lender shall commence to
accrue on the Closing Date and shall cease to accrue on the date on which the last of the Commitments of such Lender shall be terminated as
provided herein.
(b) The Borrower from time to time agrees to pay (i) to each Revolving Facility Lender of each Class (other than any Defaulting Lender), through the
Administrative Agent, on the date that is three Business Days after the last day of January, April, July and October of each year and on the date on
which the Revolving Facility Commitments of all the Lenders shall be terminated as provided herein, a fee in Dollars (an “L/C Participation Fee”) on
such Lender’s Revolving Facility Percentage of the daily average Revolving L/C Exposure (excluding the portion thereof attributable to
unreimbursed L/C Disbursements or Cash Collateralized Letters of Credit) of such Class, during the preceding quarter (or shorter period
commencing with the Closing Date or ending with the Revolving Facility Maturity Date or the date on which the Revolving Facility Commitments of
such Class shall be terminated) at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for SOFR Revolving Facility Borrowings of such Class
effective for each day in such period accrued up to the last Business Day of each January, April, July and October (or such date on which the
Commitments of all Lenders are terminated), and (ii) to each Issuing Bank, for its own account (x) on the date that is three Business Days after the
last day of January, April, July and October of each year and on the date on which the Revolving Facility Commitments of all the Lenders shall be
terminated, a fronting fee in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for the period from and including the date of issuance of
such Letter of Credit to and including the termination of such Letter of Credit, computed at a rate equal to 1/8 of 1.00% per annum of the average
daily stated amount of such Letter of Credit (using the Dollar Equivalent of any Letter of Credit denominated in Canadian Dollars in accordance
with Section 1.12), plus (y) in connection with the issuance, amendment or transfer of any such Letter of Credit or any L/C Disbursement
thereunder, such Issuing Bank’s customary documentary and processing fees and charges (collectively, “Issuing Bank Fees”). All L/C Participation
Fees and Issuing Bank Fees that are payable on a per annum basis shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of
360 days.
104
(c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Administrative Agent, the administrative and agency fees set
forth in the Fee Letter at the times specified therein (the “Administrative Agent Fees”).
(d) In the event that, on or prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, the Borrower shall (x) make a prepayment of the Term
B Loans pursuant to Section 2.11(a) with the proceeds of, or any conversion of Term B Loans into, any new or replacement tranche of long-term
secured term loans that are broadly syndicated to banks and other institutional investors in financings similar to the Term B Loans and have an All-
in Yield that is less than the All-in Yield of such Term B Loans or (y) effect any amendment to this Agreement which reduces the All-in Yield of the
Term B Loans (other than, in the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), in connection with a Change in Control or a transformative acquisition referred
to in the last sentence of this paragraph), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each of the applicable
Lenders, (A) in the case of clause (x), a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term B Loans so prepaid and (B) in
the case of clause (y), a fee equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable Term B Loans for which the All-in Yield has been
reduced pursuant to such amendment (it being understood that any such prepayment premium shall apply to any required assignment to a Non-
Consenting Lender pursuant to Section 2.19(c) in connection with any such amendment). Such amounts shall be due and payable on the date of
such prepayment or the effective date of such amendment, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 2.12(d), a “transformative acquisition”
<PAGE 44 >
is any acquisition by the Borrower or any Subsidiary that is (i) not permitted by the terms of the Loan Documents immediately prior to the
consummation of such acquisition or (ii) if permitted by the terms of the Loan Documents immediately prior to the consummation of such
acquisition, would not provide the Borrower and its Subsidiaries with adequate flexibility under the Loan Documents for the continuation and/or
expansion of their combined operations following such consummation, as reasonably determined by the Borrower in good faith.
(e) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in Dollars in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as
appropriate, among the Lenders, except that Issuing Bank Fees shall be paid directly to the applicable Issuing Banks. Once paid, none of the Fees
shall be refundable under any circumstances.
Section 2.13 Interest.
(a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the ABR plus the Applicable Margin.
(b) The Loans comprising each SOFR Borrowing shall bear interest at Adjusted Term SOFR for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus
the Applicable Margin.
(c) [reserved].
(d) [reserved].
105
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any Fees or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is
not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2.00% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as
provided in the preceding clauses of this Section 2.13 or (ii) in the case of any other overdue amount (including overdue interest), 2.00% plus the
rate applicable to ABR Loans of such Class as provided in clause (a) of this Section 2.13 (the “Default Rate”); provided, that this clause (e) shall
not apply to any Event of Default that has been waived by the Lenders pursuant to Section 9.08.
(f) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears (i) on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan, (ii) in the case of Revolving Facility
Loans, upon termination of the applicable Revolving Facility Commitments and (iii) in the case of the Term Loans, on the applicable Term Facility
Maturity Date; provided, that (A) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of a Revolving Facility Loan
that is an ABR Loan that is not made in conjunction with a permanent commitment reduction), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or
prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (B) in the event of any conversion of any SOFR Loan prior to the end of
the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(g) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the ABR at times
when the ABR is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable ABR, Adjusted Term SOFR and
Term SOFR shall each be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(h) In connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent, after consultation with the Borrower, will have the right to
make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any
amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any
Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR.
Section 2.14 Alternate Rate of Interest.
(a) Subject to clauses (b), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this Section 2.14, if prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a SOFR Borrowing:
(i) the Administrative Agent, after consultation with the Borrower, determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Adjusted Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Rate, as applicable, for
such Interest Period; provided that no Benchmark Transition Event shall have occurred at such time; or
106
(ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that Adjusted Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Rate, as applicable, for such
Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan)
included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy or electronic means as promptly as
practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice
no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a SOFR
Borrowing shall be ineffective and such Borrowing shall be converted to or continued as on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto an
ABR Borrowing (in the case of SOFR Borrowings), and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a SOFR Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as
an ABR Borrowing (in the case of SOFR Borrowings).
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark
Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark
Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date,
such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark
setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (3) of the definition of “Benchmark
Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and
under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m., Local Time, on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice
of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such
Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.
(c) [Reserved].
(d) In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right, in consultation with the
Borrower, to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any
other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further
action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
107
<PAGE 45 >
(e) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event and its
related Benchmark Replacement Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement
Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (f) below and (v) the commencement or
conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent, or, if
applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.14, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or
of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection,
will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.14.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of
a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is
not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its
reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of
information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent (after consultation
with the Borrower) may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or
non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or
information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will
no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent (after consultation with the
Borrower) may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
(g) Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a
SOFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period
and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans.
During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of
ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR.
Section 2.15 Increased Costs.
(a) If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including pursuant to regulations issued from time to time by the FRB for determining
the maximum reserve requirement (including any emergency, special, supplemental or other marginal reserve requirement) with respect to
eurocurrency funding (currently referred to as “Eurocurrency liabilities” in Regulation D)), special deposit or similar requirement against
assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or Issuing Bank; or
108
(ii) subject any Lender to any Tax with respect to any Loan Document (other than (A) Taxes indemnifiable under Section 2.17, (B) Taxes
described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes); or
(iii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans
made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any SOFR Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of
Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements or liquidity has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any,
as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued
by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company
could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s policies and the policies of such
Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such
Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its
holding company, as applicable, as specified in clause (a) or (b) of this Section 2.15 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive
absent manifest error; provided, that any such certificate claiming amounts described in clause (x) or (y) of the definition of “Change in Law” shall,
in addition, state the basis upon which such amount has been calculated and certify that such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s demand for payment of
such costs hereunder, and such method of allocation is not inconsistent with its treatment of other borrowers which, as a credit matter, are similarly
situated to the Borrower and which are subject to similar provisions. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, the
amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.
109
(d) Promptly after any Lender or any Issuing Bank has determined that it will make a request for increased compensation pursuant to this Section
2.15, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall notify the Borrower thereof. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation;
provided, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any increased costs
or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, notifies the Borrower of the Change in
Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided,
further, that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180 day period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
Section 2.16 Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow (other than due to the default of the relevant Lender), convert, continue or prepay any
SOFR Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (other than pursuant to a reallocation of Revolving Facility Loans
amongst Revolving Facility Lenders in connection with the effectiveness of Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments) or (d) the assignment of
any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19,
<PAGE 46 >
then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a
SOFR Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to be the amount determined by such Lender (it being understood that the
deemed amount shall not exceed the actual amount) to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal
amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Term SOFR that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of
such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue a SOFR Loan, for the
period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such
period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in Dollars of a comparable
amount and period from other banks in the SOFR market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall
pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof.

Section 2.17 Taxes.
(a) All payments made by or on behalf of a Loan Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and
without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes; provided, that if a Loan Party, the Administrative Agent or any other applicable
withholding agent shall be required by applicable Requirement of Law to deduct or withhold any Taxes from such payments, then (i) the applicable
withholding agent shall make such deductions or withholdings as are reasonably determined in the good faith discretion by the applicable
withholding agent to be required by any applicable Requirement of Law, (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount
deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority within the time allowed and in accordance with applicable Requirement of Law, and
(iii) to the extent withholding or deduction is required to be made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Loan Party shall be
increased as necessary so that after all required deductions and withholdings for Indemnified Taxes have been made (including deductions or
withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17) each applicable Lender (or where the Administrative Agent receives
the payment for its own account, the Administrative Agent) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or
withholdings for Indemnified Taxes been made. Whenever any Indemnified Taxes are payable by a Loan Party, as promptly as possible thereafter,
such Loan Party shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of a Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of
an official receipt (or other evidence acceptable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, acting reasonably) received by the Loan Party
showing payment thereof. Without duplication, after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to a Governmental
Authority as provided in this Section 2.17, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the
Borrower, as the case may be, a copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required
by applicable Requirements of Law to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be.
(b) The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law, or at the option of
the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(c) The Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender within 15 Business Days after written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, as the case may be
(including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.17), and any reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of the amount of such payment or liability
delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent (as applicable) on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.
111
(d) Each Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law and such other reasonably requested information as will
permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (A) whether or not any payments made hereunder or under any
other Loan Document are subject to withholding of or deduction for Taxes, (B) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and (C)
such Lender’s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, any withholding of or deduction for Taxes in respect of any payments to
be made to such Lender by any Loan Party pursuant to any Loan Document or otherwise to establish such Lender’s status for withholding tax
purposes in the applicable jurisdiction. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or
the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.17, no Lender shall be required to complete, execute or provide any documentation
(other than such documentation set forth in paragraphs (e)(i)(A), (B) and (C) of this Section and paragraph (h) of this Section) that, in the Lender’s
reasonable judgment, it is not legally eligible to provide or if such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material
unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.17(d), each Foreign Lender with respect to any Loan made to the Borrower shall, to the extent it is
legally eligible to do so:
(i) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, prior to the date on which the first payment to the Foreign Lender is due
hereunder, two copies of (A) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or
881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of “portfolio interest,” IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, in each case properly
completed and duly executed, (or any applicable successor form) (together with a certificate (substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto,
such certificate, the “Non-Bank Tax Certificate”) certifying that such Foreign Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the
Code, is not a “10-percent shareholder” (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a CFC related
to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code), and that no payment in connection with any Loan Document is
effectively connected with the conduct by such Lender of a trade or business within the United States of America), (B) IRS Form W-8BEN
or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or Form W-8ECI (or any applicable successor form), in each case properly completed and duly executed by
such Foreign Lender claiming complete exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on payments by the Borrower
under this Agreement, (C) IRS Form W-8IMY (or any applicable successor form) and all necessary attachments, properly completed and
duly executed, (including the forms described in clauses (A) and (B) above), provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a
participating Lender), and one or more of the partners is claiming portfolio interest treatment, the Non-Bank Tax Certificate may be
<PAGE 47 >
provided by such Foreign Lender on behalf of such partner(s) or (D) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming
exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be
prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be
made; and
112
(ii) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two further copies of any such form or certification (or any applicable successor
form) on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete or invalid, after the occurrence of any event
requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and from time to time
thereafter if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.
Any Foreign Lender that becomes legally ineligible to update any documentation previously delivered pursuant to Section 2.17(d), Section 2.17(e)
and Section 2.17(i) shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such Foreign Lender’s ineligibility to do so.
Each person that shall become a Participant pursuant to Section 9.04 or a Lender pursuant to Section 9.04 shall, upon the effectiveness of the
related transfer, be required to provide all the forms and statements required pursuant to Section 2.17(d), Section 2.17(e), Section 2.17(i) and Section
2.17(h); provided that a Participant shall furnish all such required forms and statements solely to the Lender from which the related participation
shall have been purchased.
Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Loan Parties and to any successor Administrative Agent any
documentation provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.17(e).
In addition, the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower (x)(I) prior to the date on which the first payment by the Borrower is due
hereunder or (II) prior to the first date on or after the date on which such Administrative Agent becomes a successor Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 8.09 on which payment by the Borrower is due hereunder, as applicable, two copies of a properly completed and executed IRS
Form W-9 certifying its exemption from U.S. federal backup withholding or such other properly completed and executed documentation prescribed
by applicable law certifying its entitlement to any available exemption from applicable U.S. federal withholding taxes in respect of any payments to
be made to such Administrative Agent by any Loan Party pursuant to any Loan Document including with respect to payments received by the
Administrative Agent for its own account, an IRS Form W-8ECI and, with respect to payments received by the Administrative Agent on behalf of a
Lender, an IRS Form W-8IMY certifying that the Administrative Agent is a U.S. branch and intends to be treated as a U.S. person for purposes of
withholding under Chapter 3 of the Code pursuant to Section 1.1441- 1(b)(2)(iv) of the Treasury Regulations, and (y) on or before the date on which
any such previously delivered documentation expires or becomes obsolete or invalid, after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the
most recent documentation previously delivered by it to the Borrower, and from time to time if reasonably requested by the Borrower, two further
copies of such documentation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Administrative Agent is not required to provide any documentation
that it is not legally eligible to provide as a result of any Change in Law occurring after the date hereof.
113
(f) If any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of an Indemnified Tax for
which a payment of additional amounts or indemnification payments has been made by a Loan Party pursuant to this Section 2.17 or any other
Loan Document, which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, is attributable to such
payment made by such Loan Party, then the Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall reimburse the Loan Party for such
amount (net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and without interest other
than any interest received thereon from the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund) as the Lender or Administrative Agent,
as the case may be, determines in its sole discretion to be the proportion of the refund as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or
worse position (taking into account expenses or any Taxes imposed on the refund) than it would have been in if the Indemnified Tax giving rise to
such refund had not been imposed in the first instance and such additional amounts or indemnification payments had not been paid; provided that
the Loan Party, upon the request of the Lender or the Administrative Agent agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Loan Party (plus any
penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Lender or the Administrative Agent in the event the
Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. In such event, such Lender or
the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall, at the Borrower’s request, provide the Borrower with a copy of any notice of assessment or
other evidence of the requirement to repay such refund received from the relevant Governmental Authority (provided that such Lender or the
Administrative Agent may delete any information therein that it deems confidential). Neither any Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be
obliged to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party in connection
with this clause (f) or any other provision of this Section 2.17.
(g) If the Borrower determines that a reasonable basis exists that an Indemnified Tax for which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts or
indemnification payments pursuant to this Section 2.17 was not correctly or legally asserted, each affected Lender or Agent, as the case may be,
shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower as the Borrower may reasonably request in pursuing a refund of such Tax. The
Borrower shall indemnify and hold each Lender and Agent harmless against any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such person in connection
with any request made by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.17(g). Nothing in this Section 2.17(g) shall obligate any Lender or Agent to take
any action that such person, in its sole judgment, determines may result in a material detriment to such person.
(h) Each U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two IRS Forms W-9 (or substitute or successor form), properly
completed and duly executed, certifying that such U.S. Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding (i) on or prior to the Closing Date (or
on or prior to the date it becomes a party to this Agreement), (ii) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete or invalid, (iii)
after the occurrence of a change in the U.S. Lender’s circumstances requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and (iv) from time to time thereafter if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.
114
(i) If a payment made to any Lender or any Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding
tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender or such Agent were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those
contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender or such Agent shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such
documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply
with their obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to
<PAGE 48 >
determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(i), “FATCA” shall include any
amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(j) The agreements in this Section 2.17 shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Issuing Bank, the
replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term “Lender” includes any Issuing Bank.
Section 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) Unless otherwise specified, the Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or
reimbursement of L/C Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Sections 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 p.m., Local Time, on the
date when due, in immediately available funds. Each such payment shall be made without condition or deduction for any defense, recoupment, set-
off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been
received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative
Agent to the applicable account designated to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent, except payments to be made directly to the applicable
Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.05 shall be made directly to the
persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the
appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if any payment hereunder shall be due on a
day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment
accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments made under the Loan Documents shall be made in
Dollars (in the case of Letters of Credit denominated in Canadian Dollars, taking the Dollar Equivalent of any L/C Disbursements). Any payment
required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent
shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of
the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.
115
(b) Subject to Section 7.02, if at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent from the Borrower to pay fully
all amounts of principal, unreimbursed L/C Disbursements, interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i)
first, towards payment of interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, (ii) second, towards payment of unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due from the
Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due to
such parties, and (iii) third, towards payment of principal then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of, or interest on,
any of its Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements of a given Class resulting in such Lender receiving payment
of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements of such Class
and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender entitled to receive the same proportion of such payment, then the
Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase participations in the Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and participations in L/C
Disbursements of such Class of such other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by all such
Lenders entitled thereto ratably in accordance with the principal amount of each such Lender’s respective Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans
and participations in L/C Disbursements of such Class and accrued interest thereon; provided, that (i) if any such participations are purchased and
all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the
extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this clause (c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the
Borrower pursuant to, and in accordance with the express terms of, this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements to any assignee or participant. The Borrower
consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant
to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if
such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact
made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
116
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06 or 2.18(d), then the Administrative
Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
Section 2.19 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or any event that gives rise to the operation of Section 2.20, then
such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights
and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17 or mitigate the applicability of Section 2.20, as applicable,
in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to
such Lender in any material respect. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection
with any such designation or assignment.
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 or gives notice under Section 2.20, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional
amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting
Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require any such Lender to
assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and
<PAGE 49 >
obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts
such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if in respect of any
Revolving Facility Commitment or Revolving Facility Loan and the Issuing Banks), to the extent consent would be required under Section 9.04(b)
for an assignment of Revolving Facility Loans or Revolving Facility Commitments, as applicable, which consent, in each case, shall not
unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans
and participations in L/C Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder from the assignee (to
the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any
such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15, payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17 or a notice
given under Section 2.20, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. Nothing in this Section 2.19 shall be
deemed to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender. No action by or consent of the removed
Lender shall be necessary in connection with such assignment, which shall be immediately and automatically effective upon payment of the
purchase price specified in clause (ii) above. In connection with any such assignment the Borrower, Administrative Agent, such removed Lender
and the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 9.04, provided, that if such removed Lender does not comply with Section 9.04
within one Business Day after the Borrower’s request, compliance with Section 9.04 shall not be required to effect such assignment.
117
(c) If any Lender (such Lender, a “Non-Consenting Lender”) has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination
which pursuant to the terms of Section 9.08 requires the consent of all of the Lenders affected and with respect to which the Required Lenders,
Required Revolving Facility Lenders or Majority Lenders, as applicable, shall have granted their consent, then the Borrower shall have the right
(unless such Non-Consenting Lender grants such consent) at its sole expense (including with respect to the processing and recordation fee
referred to in Section 9.04(b)(ii)(B)) to replace such Non-Consenting Lender by requiring such Non-Consenting Lender to (and any such Non-
Consenting Lender agrees that it shall, upon the Borrower’s request) assign its Loans and its Commitments (or, at the Borrower’s option, the Loans
and Commitments under the Facility that is the subject of the proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination) hereunder to one or more
assignees reasonably acceptable (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to (i) the Administrative Agent and (ii) if in respect of
any Revolving Facility Commitment or Revolving Facility Loan and the Issuing Banks, in each case, to the extent consent would be required under
Section 9.04(b) for an assignment of Loans or commitments, as applicable; provided, that: (a) all Loan Obligations of the Borrower owing to such
Non-Consenting Lender being replaced shall be paid in full to such Non-Consenting Lender concurrently with such assignment, (b) the
replacement Lender shall purchase the foregoing by paying to such Non-Consenting Lender a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon and the replacement Lender or, at the option of the Borrower, the Borrower shall pay any amount required by
Section 2.12(d)(y), if applicable, and (c) the replacement Lender shall grant its consent with respect to the applicable proposed amendment, waiver,
discharge or termination. No action by or consent of the Non-Consenting Lender shall be necessary in connection with such assignment, which
shall be immediately and automatically effective upon payment of the purchase price specified in clause (b) above. In connection with any such
assignment the Borrower, Administrative Agent, such Non-Consenting Lender and the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section
9.04; provided, that if such Non-Consenting Lender does not comply with Section 9.04 within one Business Day after the Borrower’s request,
compliance with Section 9.04 shall not be required to effect such assignment.
Section 2.20 Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has
asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make or maintain any SOFR Loans, then, on
notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligations of such Lender to make or continue SOFR Loans
or to convert ABR Borrowings to SOFR Borrowings shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that
the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall upon demand from such Lender
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), convert all SOFR Borrowings of such Lender to ABR Borrowings, either on the last day of the Interest
Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Borrowings to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not
lawfully continue to maintain such Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount
so converted.
118
Section 2.21 Incremental Commitments.
(a) The Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent from time to time, establish Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or
Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, as applicable, in an amount not to exceed the Incremental Amount available at the time such
Incremental Commitments are established (or at the time any commitment relating thereto is entered into or, at the option of the Borrower, at the time
of incurrence of the Incremental Loans thereunder or, with respect to any Incremental Term Loan Commitment and/or Incremental Revolving Facility
Commitment established for purposes of financing any Permitted Business Acquisition or any other acquisition or similar Investment that is
permitted by this Agreement, as of the date the definitive agreement with respect to such Permitted Business Acquisition, acquisition or similar
Investment is entered into) from one or more Incremental Term Lenders and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Lenders (which may include any
existing Lender) willing to provide such Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, as the case may be, in their
own discretion; provided, that each Incremental Revolving Facility Lender providing a commitment to make revolving loans shall be subject to the
approval of the Administrative Agent and, to the extent the same would be required for an assignment under Section 9.04(g) and the Issuing Banks
(which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), in each case, unless such Incremental Revolving Facility Lender is a Revolving
Facility Lender prior to the establishment of such Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments. Such notice shall set forth (i) the amount of the
Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments being established (which shall be in minimum increments
of $5,000,000 and a minimum aggregate amount of $10,000,000, or equal to the remaining Incremental Amount or, in each case, such lesser amount
approved by the Administrative Agent), (ii) the date on which such Incremental Term Loan Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Facility
Commitments are anticipated to become effective, (iii) in the case of Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, whether such Incremental
Revolving Facility Commitments are to be (x) commitments to make additional Revolving Facility Loans on the same terms as the Initial Revolving
Loans or (y) commitments to make revolving loans with pricing terms, final maturity dates, participation in mandatory prepayments or commitment
reductions and/or other terms different from the Initial Revolving Loans (“Other Revolving Loans”) and (iv) in the case of Incremental Term Loan
Commitments, whether such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are to be (x) commitments to make term loans on the same terms as the Term B
Loans or (y) commitments to make term loans with pricing, maturity, amortization, participation in mandatory prepayments and/or other terms
different from the Term B Loans (“Other Term Loans”).
119
<PAGE 50 >
(b) The Borrower and each Incremental Term Lender and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the
Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such Incremental Term Lender and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment of such Incremental
Revolving Facility Lender. Each Incremental Assumption Agreement shall specify the terms of the applicable Incremental Term Loans and/or
Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments; provided, that:
(i) any commitments to make additional Term B Loans and/or additional Initial Revolving Loans shall have the same terms as the Term B
Loans or Initial Revolving Loans, respectively,
(ii) the Other Term Loans incurred pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 2.21 shall rank pari passu or, at the option of the Borrower, junior in
right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Term B Loans or be unsecured (provided, that if such Other Term Loans rank
junior in right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Term B Loans, such Other Term Loans shall be subject to a
Permitted Junior Intercreditor Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Other Term Loans rank junior in right of security with the
Liens on the Collateral securing the Term B Loans or are unsecured, such Other Term Loans shall not be subject to clause (vii) below),
(iii) (A) the final maturity date of any such Other Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Term B Facility Maturity Date and (B) except as to
pricing, amortization, final maturity date, participation in mandatory prepayments and ranking as to security (which shall, subject to the
other clauses of this proviso, be determined by the Borrower and the Incremental Term Lenders in their sole discretion), shall have (x)
substantially similar terms as the Term B Loans or (y) such other terms (including as to guarantees and collateral) as shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
(iv) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any such Other Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to
Maturity of the Term B Loans,
(v) the Other Revolving Loans incurred pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 2.21 shall rank pari passu or, at the option of the Borrower,
junior in right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Initial Revolving Loans or be unsecured (provided, that if such
Other Revolving Loans rank junior in right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Initial Revolving Loans, such Other
Revolving Loans shall be subject to a Permitted Junior Intercreditor Agreement),
(vi) the final maturity date of any such Other Revolving Loans shall be no earlier than the Revolving Facility Maturity Date with respect to
the Initial Revolving Loans and, except as to pricing, final maturity date, participation in mandatory prepayments and commitment
reductions and ranking as to security (which shall, subject to the other clauses of this proviso, be determined by the Borrower and the
Incremental Revolving Facility Lenders in their sole discretion), such Other Revolving Loans shall have (x) substantially similar terms as
the Initial Revolving Loans or (y) such other terms (including as to guarantees and collateral) as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent,
120
(vii) with respect to any Subject Term Loan, the All-in Yield of the Subject Term Loan shall not exceed the All-in Yield applicable to the
Term B Loans on the Closing Date, except that the All-in Yield in respect of any such Subject Term Loan may exceed the All-in Yield in
respect of such Term B Loans on the Closing Date by no more than 0.50%, or if it does so exceed such All-in Yield by more than 0.50%
(such difference, the “Term Yield Differential”) then the Applicable Margin (or the “SOFR floor” as provided in the following proviso)
applicable to such Term B Loans shall be increased such that after giving effect to such increase, the Term Yield Differential shall not
exceed 0.50%; provided that, to the extent any portion of the Term Yield Differential is attributable to a higher “Term SOFR floor” being
applicable to such Subject Term Loan, such floor shall only be included in the calculation of the Term Yield Differential to the extent such
floor is greater than the Adjusted Term SOFR in effect for an Interest Period of three months’ duration at such time, and, with respect to
such excess, the “Term SOFR floor” applicable to the outstanding Term B Loans shall be increased to an amount not to exceed the “Term
SOFR floor” applicable to such Subject Term Loan prior to any increase in the Applicable Margin applicable to such Term B Loans then
outstanding; provided, further, that this clause (vii) shall not be applicable to any Subject Term Loan that (A) is initially incurred under
clauses (i) or (iii) under the definition of “Incremental Amount” and/or (B) has a maturity date that is at least two (2) years after the Term B
Facility Maturity Date (this clause (vii), the “MFN Provision”);
(viii) (A) such Other Revolving Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not a greater than pro rata basis)
(and, in the case of Other Revolving Loans secured by Liens that are junior in right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing
the Initial Revolving Loans, on a junior basis) than the Initial Revolving Loans in (x) any voluntary or mandatory prepayment or
commitment reduction hereunder and (y) any Borrowing at the time such Borrowing is made and (B) such Other Term Loans may
participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not a greater than pro rata basis) (and, in the case of Other Term Loans
secured by Liens that are junior in right of security with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Term B Loans, on a junior basis) than the
Term B Loans in any mandatory prepayment hereunder; and
(ix) (A) there shall be no obligor in respect of any Incremental Term Loan Commitments or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments
that is not a Loan Party and (B) no Incremental Term Loan Commitments or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments shall be secured
by any assets that do not constitute Collateral.
Each party hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Assumption Agreement, this Agreement and any other Loan
Documents shall be amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Incremental Term Loan
Commitments and/or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments evidenced thereby as provided for in Section 9.08(e). Any amendment to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document that is necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 2.21 and any such collateral and other
documentation shall be deemed “Loan Documents” hereunder and may be memorialized in writing by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower
and furnished to the other parties hereto.
121
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Term Loan Commitment or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment shall become effective
under this Section 2.21 unless (i) on the date of such effectiveness, (A) solely to the extent required by the relevant Incremental Assumption
Agreement, the conditions set forth in clause (c) of Section 4.01 shall be satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to
that effect dated such date and executed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower and (B) (I) if such Incremental Term Loan Commitment or
Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment is established to finance any Permitted Business Acquisition or any other similar permitted Investment,
no Event of Default under Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom or (II) if such Incremental
Term Loan Commitment or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment is established for any other purpose, no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred or be continuing or would result therefrom and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received customary legal opinions, board
resolutions and other customary closing certificates and documentation to the extent required by the relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement
<PAGE 51 >
and, to the extent required by the Administrative Agent, consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date under Section 4.02 and such
additional customary documents and filings (including amendments or supplements to the Collateral Documents, as applicable, and modification
endorsements, which, in the case of such amendments or supplements and modification endorsements, may be delivered on a post-closing basis to
the extent permitted by the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, the relevant Collateral Documents or hereunder) as the Administrative
Agent may reasonably request to assure that the Incremental Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Loans in respect of Incremental Revolving
Facility Commitments are secured by Liens on the Collateral ratably with (or, to the extent set forth in the applicable Incremental Assumption
Agreement, junior to) one or more Classes of then-existing Term Loans and Revolving Facility Loans.
(d) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may take any and all action as may be reasonably necessary to ensure
that (i) all Incremental Term Loans (other than Other Term Loans of a different Class), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of the
outstanding applicable Class of Term Loans on a pro rata basis, and (ii) all Revolving Facility Loans in respect of Incremental Revolving Facility
Commitments (other than Revolving Facility Loans of a different Class), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of the applicable
Class of outstanding Revolving Facility Loans on a pro rata basis. The Borrower agrees that Section 2.16 shall apply to any conversion of SOFR
Loans to ABR Loans reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to effect the foregoing.
122
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (e)
through (i) of this Section 2.21), pursuant to one or more offers made from time to time by the Borrower to all Lenders of any Class of Term Loans
and/or Revolving Facility Commitments, on a pro rata basis (based, in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Class of Term Loans, on the
aggregate outstanding Term Loans of such Class and, in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Revolving Facility, on the aggregate
outstanding Revolving Facility Commitments under such Revolving Facility, as applicable) and on the same terms (“Pro Rata Extension Offers”),
the Borrower is hereby permitted to consummate transactions with individual Lenders from time to time to extend the maturity date of such Lender’s
Loans and/or Commitments of such Class and to otherwise modify the terms of such Lender’s Loans and/or Commitments of such Class pursuant
to the terms of the relevant Pro Rata Extension Offer (including, without limitation, increasing the interest rate or fees payable in respect of such
Lender’s Loans and/or Commitments and/or modifying the amortization schedule in respect of such Lender’s Loans). For the avoidance of doubt,
the reference to “on the same terms” in the preceding sentence shall mean, (i) in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Class of Term Loans,
that all of the Term Loans of such Class are offered to be extended for the same amount of time and that the interest rate changes and fees payable
with respect to such extension are the same and (ii) in the case of an offer to the Lenders under any Revolving Facility, that all of the Revolving
Facility Commitments of such Facility are offered to be extended for the same amount of time and that the interest rate changes and fees payable
with respect to such extension are the same. Any such extension (an “Extension”) agreed to between the Borrower and any such Lender (an
“Extending Lender”) will be established under this Agreement by implementing an Incremental Term Loan for such Lender if such Lender is
extending an existing Term Loan (such extended Term Loan, an “Extended Term Loan”) or an Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment for such
Lender if such Lender is extending an existing Revolving Facility Commitment (such extended Revolving Facility Commitment, an “Extended
Revolving Facility Commitment” and any Revolving Facility Loans made thereunder, “Extended Revolving Loans”). Each Pro Rata Extension Offer
shall specify the date on which the Borrower proposes that the Extended Term Loan shall be made or Extended Revolving Facility Commitment shall
become effective, which shall be a date not earlier than five Business Days after the date on which notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent
(or such shorter period agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion).
123
(f) The Borrower and each Extending Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and
such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving
Facility Commitments of such Extending Lender. Each Incremental Assumption Agreement shall specify the terms of the applicable Extended Term
Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments; provided, that (i) except as to interest rates, fees and any other pricing terms (which
interest rates, fees and other pricing terms shall not be subject to the provisions set forth in Section 2.21(b)(vii)), and amortization, final maturity
date and participation in prepayments and commitment reductions (which shall, subject to clauses (ii) and (iii) of this proviso, be determined by the
Borrower and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer), the Extended Term Loans shall have (x) the same terms as an existing Class of Term Loans
or (y) such other terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (ii) the final maturity date of any Extended Term Loans shall
be no earlier than the latest Term Facility Maturity Date in effect on the date of incurrence, (iii) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any
Extended Term Loans shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Class of Term Loans to which such offer
relates, (iv) except as to interest rates, fees, any other pricing terms, participation in mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions and final
maturity (which shall be determined by the Borrower and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer), any Extended Revolving Facility Commitment
shall have (x) the same terms as an existing Class of Revolving Facility Commitments or (y) have such other terms as shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and, in respect of any other terms that would affect the rights or duties of any Issuing Bank, such terms as
shall be reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank, (v) any Extended Revolving Facility Commitments may participate on a pro rata basis or a
less than pro rata basis (but not greater than a pro rata basis) than the Initial Revolving Loans in any voluntary or mandatory prepayment or
commitment reduction hereunder and (vi) any Extended Term Loans may participate on a pro rata basis or a less than pro rata basis (but not a
greater than pro rata basis) than the Term B Loans in any mandatory prepayment hereunder. Upon the effectiveness of any Incremental
Assumption Agreement, this Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect
the existence and terms of the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments evidenced thereby as provided for in Section
9.08(e). Any such deemed amendment may be memorialized in writing by the Administrative Agent with the Borrower’s consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld) and furnished to the other parties hereto. If provided in any Incremental Assumption Agreement with respect to any
Extended Revolving Facility Commitments, and with the consent of each Issuing Bank, participations in Letters of Credit shall be reallocated to
lenders holding such Extended Revolving Facility Commitments in the manner specified in such Incremental Assumption Agreement, including
upon effectiveness of such Extended Revolving Facility Commitment or upon or prior to the maturity date for any Class of Revolving Facility
Commitments.
124
(g) Upon the effectiveness of any such Extension, the applicable Extending Lender’s Term Loan will be automatically designated an Extended Term
Loan and/or such Extending Lender’s Revolving Facility Commitment will be automatically designated an Extended Revolving Facility Commitment.
For purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (i) if such Extending Lender is extending a Term Loan, such Extending Lender will
be deemed to have an Incremental Term Loan having the terms of such Extended Term Loan and (ii) if such Extending Lender is extending a
<PAGE 52 >
Revolving Facility Commitment, such Extending Lender will be deemed to have an Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment having the terms of
such Extended Revolving Facility Commitment.
(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including, without limitation, this Section
2.21), (i) the aggregate amount of Extended Term Loans and Extended Revolving Facility Commitments will not be included in the calculation of the
Incremental Amount, (ii) no Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving Facility Commitment is required to be in any minimum amount or any
minimum increment, (iii) any Extending Lender may extend all or any portion of its Term Loans and/or Revolving Facility Commitment pursuant to
one or more Pro Rata Extension Offers (subject to applicable proration in the case of over participation) (including the extension of any Extended
Term Loan and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitment), (iv) there shall be no condition to any Extension of any Loan or Commitment at any
time or from time to time other than notice to the Administrative Agent of such Extension and the terms of the Extended Term Loan or Extended
Revolving Facility Commitment implemented thereby, (v) all Extended Term Loans, Extended Revolving Facility Commitments and all obligations in
respect thereof shall be Loan Obligations of the relevant Loan Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are secured by
Liens on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with all other Obligations relating to an existing Class of Term Loans of the relevant Loan Parties under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (vi) no Issuing Bank shall be obligated to issue Letters of Credit under such Extended Revolving
Facility Commitments unless it shall have consented thereto and (vii) there shall be no obligor in respect of any such Extended Term Loans or
Extended Revolving Facility Commitments that is not a Loan Party.
125
(i) Each Extension shall be consummated pursuant to procedures set forth in the associated Pro Rata Extension Offer; provided, that the Borrower
shall cooperate with the Administrative Agent prior to making any Pro Rata Extension Offer to establish reasonable procedures with respect to
mechanical provisions relating to such Extension, including, without limitation, timing, rounding and other adjustments.
(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (j)
through (o) of this Section 2.21), the Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent establish one or more additional tranches of term
loans under this Agreement (such loans, “Refinancing Term Loans”), which are used to Refinance in whole or in part any Class of Term Loans.
Each such notice shall specify the date (each, a “Refinancing Effective Date”) on which the Borrower proposes that the Refinancing Term Loans
shall be made, which shall be a date not earlier than five Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative
Agent (or such shorter period agreed to by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion); provided, that:
(i) before and after giving effect to the Borrowing of such Refinancing Term Loans on the Refinancing Effective Date each of the
conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall be satisfied to the extent required by the relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement governing
such Refinancing Term Loans;
(ii) the final maturity date of the Refinancing Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Term Facility Maturity Date of the refinanced Term
Loans;
(iii) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Refinancing Term Loans shall be no shorter than the then-remaining Weighted
Average Life to Maturity of the refinanced Term Loans;
(iv) the aggregate principal amount of the Refinancing Term Loans shall not exceed the outstanding principal amount of the refinanced
Term Loans plus amounts used to pay fees, premiums, costs and expenses (including original issue discount) and accrued interest
associated therewith;
(v) all other terms applicable to such Refinancing Term Loans (other than provisions relating to original issue discount, upfront fees,
interest rates and any other pricing terms (which original issue discount, upfront fees, interest rates and other pricing terms shall not be
subject to the provisions set forth in Section 2.21(b)(vii)), final maturity date, amortization and optional prepayment or mandatory
prepayment or redemption terms, which shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders providing such Refinancing Term
Loans) taken as a whole shall be substantially similar to, or not materially less favorable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries than, the
terms, taken as a whole, applicable to the Term B Loans (except to the extent such covenants and other terms apply solely to any period
after the Term B Facility Maturity Date or are otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent), as determined by the
Borrower in good faith; and
126
(vi) there shall be no obligor in respect of such Refinancing Term Loans that is not a Loan Party.
In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may establish Refinancing Term Loans to refinance and/or replace all or any portion of a
Revolving Facility Commitment (regardless of whether Revolving Facility Loans are outstanding under such Revolving Facility Commitments at the
time of incurrence of such Refinancing Term Loans), so long as (1) the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Term Loans does not exceed
the aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Commitments terminated at the time of incurrence thereof plus amounts used to pay fees, premiums,
costs and expenses (including original issue discount) and accrued interest associated therewith, (2) if the Revolving Facility Credit Exposure
outstanding on the Refinancing Effective Date would exceed the aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Commitments outstanding in each case
after giving effect to the termination of such Revolving Facility Commitments, the Borrower shall take one or more actions such that such
Revolving Facility Credit Exposure does not exceed such aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Commitments in effect on the Refinancing
Effective Date after giving effect to the termination of such Revolving Facility Commitments (it being understood that (x) such Refinancing Term
Loans may be provided by the Lenders holding the Revolving Facility Commitments being terminated and/or by any other person that would be a
permitted Assignee hereunder and (y) the proceeds of such Refinancing Term Loans shall not constitute Net Proceeds hereunder), (3) the
Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Refinancing Term Loans (disregarding any customary amortization for this purpose) shall be no shorter
than the remaining life to termination of the terminated Revolving Facility Commitments, (4) the final maturity date of the Refinancing Term Loans
shall be no earlier than the termination date of the terminated Revolving Facility Commitments, and (5) all other terms applicable to such
Refinancing Term Loans (other than provisions relating to original issue discount, upfront fees, interest rates and any other pricing terms (which
original issue discount, upfront fees, interest rates and other pricing terms shall not be subject to the provisions set forth in Section 2.21(b)(vii)),
final maturity date, amortization and optional prepayment or mandatory prepayment or redemption terms, which shall be as agreed between the
Borrower and the Lenders providing such Refinancing Term Loans) taken as a whole shall be substantially similar to, or not materially less
favorable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries than, the terms, taken as a whole, applicable to the Term B Loans (except to the extent such
covenants and other terms apply solely to any period after the Term B Facility Maturity Date or are otherwise reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent), as determined by the Borrower in good faith.
127
<PAGE 53 >
(k) The Borrower may approach any Lender or any other person that would be a permitted Assignee pursuant to Section 9.04 to provide all or a
portion of the Refinancing Term Loans; provided, that any Lender offered or approached to provide all or a portion of the Refinancing Term Loans
may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a Refinancing Term Loan. Any Refinancing Term Loans made on any Refinancing Effective
Date shall be designated an additional Class of Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement; provided, further, that any Refinancing Term Loans
may, to the extent provided in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement governing such Refinancing Term Loans, be designated as an
increase in any previously established Class of Term Loans made to the Borrower.
(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses (l)
through (o) of this Section 2.21), the Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent establish one or more additional Facilities
providing for revolving commitments (“Replacement Revolving Facilities” and the commitments thereunder, “Replacement Revolving Facility
Commitments” and the revolving loans thereunder, “Replacement Revolving Loans”), which replace in whole or in part any Class of Revolving
Facility Commitments under this Agreement. Each such notice shall specify the date (each, a “Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date”) on
which the Borrower proposes that the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall become effective, which shall be a date not less than five
Business Days after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period agreed to by the Administrative
Agent in its reasonable discretion); provided that: (i) before and after giving effect to the establishment of such Replacement Revolving Facility
Commitments on the Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date, each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall be satisfied to the extent
required by the relevant Incremental Assumption Agreement governing such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments; (ii) after giving effect
to the establishment of any Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and any concurrent reduction in the aggregate amount of any other
Revolving Facility Commitments, the aggregate amount of Revolving Facility Commitments shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving
Facility Commitments outstanding immediately prior to the applicable Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date; (iii) no Replacement
Revolving Facility Commitments shall have a final maturity date (or require commitment reductions or amortization) prior to the Revolving Facility
Maturity Date in effect at the time of incurrence for the Revolving Facility Commitments being replaced; (iv) all other terms applicable to such
Replacement Revolving Facility (other than provisions relating to (x) fees, interest rates and other pricing terms, final maturity date and prepayment
and commitment reduction and optional redemption terms which shall be as agreed between the Borrower and the Lenders providing such
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and (y) the amount of any letter of credit sublimit under such Replacement Revolving Facility, which
shall be as agreed between the Borrower, the Lenders providing such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments, the Administrative Agent and
the replacement issuing bank, if any, under such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments) taken as a whole shall be substantially similar to, or
not materially less favorable to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries than, the terms, taken as a whole, applicable to the Initial Revolving Loans (except
to the extent such covenants and other terms apply solely to any period after the latest Revolving Facility Maturity Date in effect at the time of
incurrence or are otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent), as determined by the Borrower in good faith; and (v) there shall be
no obligor in respect of such Replacement Revolving Facility that is not a Loan Party. In addition, the Borrower may establish Replacement
Revolving Facility Commitments to refinance and/or replace all or any portion of a Term Loan hereunder (regardless of whether such Term Loan is
repaid with the proceeds of Replacement Revolving Loans or otherwise), so long as (1) the aggregate amount of such Replacement Revolving
Facility Commitments does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans repaid at the time of establishment thereof (it being
understood that such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment may be provided by the Lenders holding the Term Loans being repaid and/or by
any other person that would be a permitted Assignee hereunder), (2) before and after giving effect to the establishment such Replacement
Revolving Facility Commitments on the Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01 shall be
satisfied to the extent required by the relevant agreement governing such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments, (3) the remaining life to
termination of such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall be no shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity then applicable
to the refinanced Term Loans, (4) the final termination date of the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments shall be no earlier than the Term
Facility Maturity Date of the refinanced Term Loans, (5) with respect to Replacement Revolving Loans secured by Liens on the Collateral that rank
junior in right of security to the Initial Revolving Loans, such Liens will be subject to a Permitted Junior Intercreditor Agreement and (6) there shall
be no obligor in respect of such Replacement Revolving Facility that is not a Loan Party. Solely to the extent that an Issuing Bank is not a
replacement issuing bank under a Replacement Revolving Facility, it is understood and agreed that such Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue
any letters of credit under such Replacement Revolving Facility and, to the extent it is necessary for such Issuing Bank to withdraw as an Issuing
Bank at the time of the establishment of such Replacement Revolving Facility, such withdrawal shall be on terms and conditions reasonably
satisfactory to such Issuing Bank in its sole discretion. The Borrower agrees to reimburse each Issuing Bank in full upon demand, for any
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket cost or expense attributable to such withdrawal.
128
(m) The Borrower may approach any Lender or any other person that would be a permitted Assignee of a Revolving Facility Commitment pursuant
to Section 9.04 to provide all or a portion of the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments; provided that any Lender offered or approached to
provide all or a portion of the Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a Replacement
Revolving Facility Commitment. Any Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment made on any Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date shall
be designated an additional Class of Revolving Facility Commitments for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that any Replacement Revolving
Facility Commitments may, to the extent provided in the applicable Incremental Assumption Agreement, be designated as an increase in any
previously established Class of Revolving Facility Commitments.
(n) On any Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, each of the Lenders
with Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class shall purchase from each of the other Lenders with Replacement Revolving
Facility Commitments of such Class, at the principal amount thereof and in the applicable currencies, such interests in the Replacement Revolving
Loans and participations in Letters of Credit under such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class then outstanding on such
Replacement Revolving Facility Effective Date as shall be necessary in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, the
Replacement Revolving Loans and participations of such Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments of such Class will be held by the Lenders
thereunder ratably in accordance with their Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments.
129
(o) For purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (i) if a Lender is providing a Refinancing Term Loan, such Lender will be
deemed to have an Incremental Term Loan having the terms of such Refinancing Term Loan and (ii) if a Lender is providing a Replacement
Revolving Facility Commitment, such Lender will be deemed to have an Incremental Revolving Facility Commitment having the terms of such
Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document
(including, without limitation, this Section 2.21), (i) the aggregate amount of Refinancing Term Loans and Replacement Revolving Facility
Commitments will not be included in the calculation of the Incremental Amount, (ii) no Refinancing Term Loan or Replacement Revolving Facility
<PAGE 54 >
Commitment is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment, (iii) there shall be no condition to any incurrence of any
Refinancing Term Loan or Replacement Revolving Facility Commitment at any time or from time to time other than those set forth in clauses (j) or (l)
above, as applicable, and (iv) all Refinancing Term Loans, Replacement Revolving Facility Commitments and all obligations in respect thereof shall
be Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are secured by Liens on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with or, at the
Borrower’s option, junior to all other Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
(p) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (i) for the purpose of determining the number of outstanding SOFR Borrowings
upon the incurrence of any Incremental Loans, (x) to the extent the last date of Interest Periods for multiple SOFR Borrowings under the Term
Facilities fall on the same day, such SOFR Borrowings shall be considered a single SOFR Borrowing, as applicable, and (y) to the extent the last
date of Interest Periods for multiple SOFR Borrowings under the Revolving Facilities fall on the same day, such SOFR Borrowings shall be
considered a single SOFR Borrowing and (ii) the initial Interest Period with respect to any SOFR Borrowing of Incremental Loans may, at the
Borrower’s option, be of a duration that is not specified in the definition of “Interest Period” to correspond to the next succeeding Interest Payment
Date applicable to any then-outstanding SOFR Borrowing, and Adjusted Term SOFR with respect to such initial Interest Period shall be the same as
Adjusted Term SOFR applicable to any then-outstanding SOFR Borrowing as the Borrower may direct, so long as the last day of such initial
Interest Period is the same as the last day of the Interest Period with respect to such outstanding SOFR Borrowing.
130
Section 2.22 Defaulting Lender.
(a) Defaulting Lender Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
(i) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to
this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definitions of “Majority Lenders”, “Required Lenders” or “Required Revolving
Facility Lenders.”
(ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, following an Event of Default or otherwise) or received
by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.06 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined
by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative
Agent hereunder, second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank
hereunder, third, to Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks’ Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with
Section 2.05(j), fourth, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in
respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the
Administrative Agent, fifth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released
pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement
and (y) Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks’ future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future
Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.05(j), sixth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the
Lenders, the Issuing Banks as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender or Issuing Bank
against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement, seventh, so long
as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its
obligations under this Agreement, and eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a
Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.22 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting
Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
131
(iii) Certain Fees.
(A) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting
Lender.
(B) Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive L/C Participation Fees for any period during which that Lender is a
Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its pro rata share of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has
provided Cash Collateral.
(C) With respect to any Commitment Fee or L/C Participation Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to
clause (A) or (B) above, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable
to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in Letters of Credit that has been reallocated to
such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to each Issuing Bank the amount of any such fee otherwise

Credit shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective pro rata Commitments (calculated
without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate
Revolving Facility Credit Exposure of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Facility
Commitment. No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting
Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such
Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.

Banks’ Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j).
(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a
Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and
subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent
applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Revolving Facility Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the
<PAGE 55 >
Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held pro
rata by the Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Facility Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.22(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender
will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that, no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or
on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the
affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder
arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
132
(c) New Letters of Credit. So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Banks shall not be required to issue, extend, renew or increase
any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.

permitted Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) described in Sections 6.01(a) through (kk) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to
the clauses set forth in the definition of “Incremental Amount”), the Borrower may, in its sole discretion, divide, classify or reclassify, or later divide,
classify or reclassify (as if incurred at such later time), such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this
Section 6.01 and at the time of incurrence, division, classification or reclassification will be entitled to only include the amount and type of such item
of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in one of the above clauses (or any portion thereof) and such item of Indebtedness (or any portion
thereof) shall be treated as having been incurred or existing pursuant to only such clause or clauses (or any portion thereof) without giving pro
forma effect to such item (or any portion thereof) when calculating the amount of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) that may be incurred,
divided, classified or reclassified pursuant to any other clause (or any portion thereof) at such time (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with
respect to the clauses set forth in the definition of “Incremental Amount”); provided, that (x) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Closing Date

Section 6.01, (C) in connection with (1) the incurrence of revolving loan Indebtedness under this Section 6.01 or (2) any commitment or other
transaction relating to the incurrence of Indebtedness under this Section 6.01 and the granting of any Lien to secure such Indebtedness, the
Borrower may designate the incurrence of such Indebtedness and the granting of such Lien therefor as having occurred on the date of first
incurrence of such revolving loan Indebtedness or commitment or intention to consummate such transaction (such date, the “Deemed Date”), and
any related subsequent actual incurrence and the granting of such Lien therefor will be deemed for purposes of this Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 of
this Agreement to have been incurred or granted on such Deemed Date, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating usage of any
baskets hereunder (if applicable), the Net First Lien Leverage Ratio, the Interest Coverage Ratio and Adjusted EBITDA (and all such calculations,
without duplication, on the Deemed Date and on any subsequent date until such commitment is funded or terminated or such transaction is
consummated or abandoned or such election is rescinded shall be made on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to the deemed incurrence, the
granting of any Lien therefor and related transactions in connection therewith) and (D) for purposes of calculating the Interest Coverage Ratio, the
Net First Lien Leverage Ratio, the Net Secured Leverage Ratio and the Net Total Leverage Ratio and under Section 6.01(h), (q), (r), (s) and/or (z) on
any date of incurrence of Indebtedness pursuant to such Section 6.01(h), (q), (r), (s) and/or (z), the net cash proceeds funded by financing sources
upon the incurrence of such Indebtedness incurred at such time of calculation shall not be netted against the applicable amount of Consolidated
Debt for purposes of such calculation of the Interest Coverage Ratio, the Net First Lien Leverage Ratio, the Net Secured Leverage Ratio or the Net
Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, at such time. In addition, with respect to any Indebtedness that was permitted to be incurred hereunder on the
date of such incurrence, any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness shall also be permitted hereunder after the date of such incurrence, and (E) in
the case of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, (x) the original amount of Refinanced Indebtedness in respect thereof (including with respect
to successive Refinancings) will continue to be considered to have been incurred under the clause of this Section 6.01 in reliance on which such
Refinanced Indebtedness was initially incurred (or to which such Refinanced Indebtedness at such time has been classified, as applicable), and (y)
if Refinanced Indebtedness was initially incurred in reliance on (or at such time has been classified to, as applicable) a clause of this Section 6.01
that is subject to a Cap, and such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness would cause such Cap to be exceeded, then such Cap will be deemed not to
be exceeded to the extent that the aggregate principal amount of the Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to replace the Refinanced Indebtedness
complies with clause (a) of the definition of “Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness” (it being understood and agreed that the availability of a
separate basket for Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness is not intended to permit a “refresh” of the basket in this Section 6.01 subject to a Cap
under which Refinanced Indebtedness was initially incurred (or to which Refinanced Indebtedness at such time has been classified, as applicable)).
161
This Agreement will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior in right of payment to secured Indebtedness merely because it
is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior in right of payment to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a
junior priority with respect to the same collateral.

permitted solely by reference to one category of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in Sections 6.02(a) through (oo) but may be
permitted in part under any combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the
criteria of one or more of the categories of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in Sections 6.02(a) through (oo), the Borrower may, in
its sole discretion, divide, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify (as if incurred at such later time), such Lien securing such item
of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this Section 6.02 and at the time of incurrence, division, classification or
reclassification will be entitled to only include the amount and type of such Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien (or any portion
thereof) in one of the above clauses (or any portion thereof) and such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) will be
treated as being incurred or existing pursuant to only such clause or clauses (or any portion thereof) without giving pro forma effect to such item
(or any portion thereof) when calculating the amount of Liens or Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) that may be incurred, divided, classified or
reclassified pursuant to any other clause (or any portion thereof) at such time. In addition, with respect to any Indebtedness that is designated to
be incurred on any Deemed Date pursuant to clause (C) of the second to last paragraph of Section 6.01, any Lien that does or that shall secure such
Indebtedness may also be designated by the Borrower or any Subsidiary to be incurred on such Deemed Date and, in such event, any related
subsequent actual incurrence of such Lien shall be deemed for purposes of Section 6.01 and 6.02 of this Agreement, without duplication, to be
incurred on such prior date (and on any subsequent date until such commitment is funded or terminated or such election is rescinded or until such
time as the related Indebtedness is no longer deemed outstanding pursuant to clause (C) of the second to last paragraph of Section 6.01), including

such Indebtedness at the time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. In the case of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness or other newly incurred obligations secured by a Lien, (x) the original amount
of Refinanced Indebtedness or other obligations (including with respect to successive Refinancings) will continue to be considered to have been
incurred under the clause of this Section 6.02 in reliance on which such Lien was initially incurred (or to which such Lien at such time has been
classified, as applicable), and (y) if any Liens securing Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness or other obligations are incurred to Refinance Liens
securing Refinanced Indebtedness or other obligations initially incurred in reliance on a clause of this Section 6.02 measured by a Cap, and such
Refinancing would cause such Cap to be exceeded, then such clause will be deemed not to be exceeded to the extent that the aggregate principal
amount of the Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness or new obligations incurred to replace such existing obligations complies with clause (a) of the
definition of “Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness” or clause (kk) of this Section 6.02, as applicable.

Section; provided, that the amount of each such increase in respect of one Related Section shall be treated as having been used under the other
Related Section.
 
Any Investment in any person other than the Borrower or a Subsidiary Guarantor that is otherwise permitted by this Section 6.04 may be made
through intermediate Investments in Subsidiaries that are not Loan Parties and such intermediate Investments shall be disregarded for purposes of

determination of the amount of such Investment (or any portion thereof) that may be made pursuant to the Investment Incurrence Clause shall be
made without giving pro forma effect to any substantially concurrent Investment (or any portion thereof) divided, classified or reclassified under
any of the above clauses other than the Investment Incurrence Clause or the incurrence of Indebtedness to finance any such Investment (or any
portion thereof).

with accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities of the Borrower accrued hereunder with respect to such
Revolving Facility Loans, shall become forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding.
 
For purposes of each of (i) clauses (h), (i) and (j) of this Section 7.01 and (ii) Section 5.04(a), “Material Subsidiary” (1) shall mean any Subsidiary
(other than the Borrower) that would not be an Immaterial Subsidiary under clause (i) of the definition thereof and (2) shall exclude any Special
Purpose Securitization Subsidiary.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, a notice of Default may not be given by the
Administrative Agent or by any Secured Party (or any other action taken on the assertion of any Default) with respect to any action taken, and
reported to the Lenders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default (or other action) other than with respect to an Event of Default under
clause (b), (c), (h), (i) or (l) of Section 7.01.
 
Section 7.02       Treatment of Certain Payments. Subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, any amount received by the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent from any Loan Party (or from proceeds of any Collateral) following any acceleration of the Obligations
under this Agreement or any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower under Section 7.01(h) or (i), in each case that is continuing, shall be
applied: (i) first, ratably, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense reimbursements then due to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent from
the Borrower (other than in connection with any Secured Cash Management Agreement or Secured Hedge Agreement), (ii) second, towards
payment of interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
interest and fees then due to such parties, (iii) third, towards payment of unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due from the Borrower hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due to such parties, (iv) fourth,
towards payment of other Obligations (including Obligations of the Loan Parties owing under or in respect of any Secured Cash Management
Agreement or Secured Hedge Agreement) then due from the Borrower or any other Loan Party, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of such Obligations then due to such parties and (v) last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been
paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Requirements of Law.
 
193
 
Section 7.03       Right to Cure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.01, in the event that the Borrower fails (or, but for
<PAGE 82 >
the operation of this Section 7.03, would fail) to comply with the requirements of the Financial Covenant, from the last day of the applicable Fiscal
Quarter until the expiration of the 10th Business Day subsequent to the date the Compliance Certificate calculating such Financial Covenant is
required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.04(c), Holdings, the Borrower and any Parent Entity shall have the right to issue Permitted Cure
Securities for cash or otherwise receive cash contributions to the capital of such entities, and in each case, to contribute any such cash to the
capital of the Borrower as a common equity contribution (collectively, the “Cure Right”), and upon the receipt by the Borrower of such cash (the
“Cure Amount”), pursuant to the exercise of the Cure Right, the Financial Covenant shall be recalculated giving effect to a pro forma adjustment by
which Adjusted EBITDA shall be increased with respect to such applicable quarter and any four- quarter period that contains such quarter, solely
for the purpose of measuring the Financial Covenant and not for any other purpose under this Agreement, by an amount equal to the Cure
Amount; provided, that (i) in each four consecutive Fiscal Quarter period there shall be at least two Fiscal Quarters in which a Cure Right is not
exercised, (ii) a Cure Right shall not be exercised more than five times during the term of the Revolving Facility, (iii) for purposes of this Section 7.03,
the Cure Amount shall be no greater than the amount required for purposes of complying with the Financial Covenant and (iv) there shall be no pro
forma reduction in Indebtedness with the proceeds of the exercise of the Cure Right for determining compliance with the Financial Covenant for the
Fiscal Quarter in respect of which such Cure Right is exercised (either directly through prepayment or indirectly as a result of the netting of
Unrestricted Cash). If, after giving effect to the adjustments in this Section 7.03, the Borrower shall then be in compliance with the requirements of
the Financial Covenant, the Borrower shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the Financial Covenant as of the relevant date of
determination with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such date, and the applicable breach or default of the
Financial Covenant that had occurred shall be deemed cured for the purposes of this Agreement. Neither the Collateral Agent, Administrative
Agent nor any Lender shall exercise the right to accelerate the Loans or terminate the Revolving Facility Commitments and none of the Collateral
Agent, Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Secured Party shall exercise any right to foreclose on or take possession of the Collateral or
exercise any other remedy pursuant to Section 7.01, the other Loan Documents or applicable law prior to the end of the applicable Cure Right period
solely on the basis of an Event of Default having occurred and continuing under Section 7.01(d) with respect to Section 6.11 (except to the extent
that the Borrower has confirmed in writing that it does not intend to provide the Cure Amount); provided that no Lender shall be obligated to make
any Revolving Facility Loan or issue or amend any Letter of Credit under the Revolving Facility until (i) such Cure Amount has been received by
the Borrower and (ii) the applicable breach or default of the Financial Covenant that had occurred has been deemed cured pursuant to this
Section 7.03.

ARTICLE VIII
 
The Agents
 
Section 8.01       Appointment.
 
(a)            Each Lender (in its capacities as a Lender and on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as potential counterparties to Secured Cash
Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements) and each Issuing Bank (in such capacities and on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as
potential counterparties to Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements) hereby irrevocably designates and appoints
the Administrative Agent as the agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the Collateral Agent as the agent
of such Lender and the other Secured Parties under the Collateral Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent, in such capacities, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent
by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. In addition,
to the extent required under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America, each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby
grants to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent any required powers of attorney to execute any Collateral Document governed by the
laws of such jurisdiction on such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s behalf. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement,
the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent.
 
(b)           In furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender (in its capacities as a Lender and on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as potential
counterparties to Secured Cash Management Agreements or Secured Hedge Agreements) and each Issuing Bank (in such capacities and on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates as potential counterparties to Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements) hereby appoints
and authorizes the Collateral Agent to act as the agent of such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on
Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably
incidental thereto. In this connection, the Collateral Agent (and any Subagents appointed by the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 for
purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any
rights or remedies thereunder at the direction of the Collateral Agent) shall be entitled to the benefits of this Article VIII (including, without
limitation, Sections 8.07 and 8.09) as though the Collateral Agent (and any such Subagents) were an “Agent” under the Loan Documents, as if set
forth in full herein with respect thereto.
 
195
 
(c)           (i) Each Lender hereby agrees that (x) if the Administrative Agent notifies such Lender that the Administrative Agent has determined in its
sole discretion that any funds received by such Lender from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (whether as a payment, prepayment or
sole discretion that any funds received by such Lender from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (whether as a payment, prepayment or
repayment of principal, interest, fees or otherwise; individually and collectively, a “Payment”) were erroneously transmitted to such Lender
(whether or not known to such Lender), and demands the return of such Payment (or a portion thereof), such Lender shall promptly, but in no event
later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a
demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion
thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate
<PAGE 83 >
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect, and (y) to
the extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender shall not assert, and hereby waives, as to the Administrative Agent, any claim, counterclaim,
defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any
Payments received, including without limitation any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine. A notice of the Administrative
Agent to any Lender under this Section 8.01(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
(ii)            Each Lender hereby further agrees that if it receives a Payment from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (x) that is in
a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its
Affiliates) with respect to such Payment (a “Payment Notice”) or (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a Payment Notice, it shall
be on notice, in each such case, that an error has been made with respect to such Payment. Each Lender agrees that, in each such case, or
if it otherwise becomes aware a Payment (or portion thereof) may have been sent in error, such Lender shall promptly notify the
Administrative Agent of such occurrence and, upon demand from the Administrative Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than
one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a
demand was made in same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or
portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the NYFRB
Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time
to time in effect.
 
(iii)            The Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby agrees that (x) in the event an erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) are not
recovered from any Lender that has received such Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be
subrogated to all the rights of such Lender with respect to such amount and (y) an erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay,
discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party unless such funds were, and solely with
respect to the amount of such funds that were, made with funds provided to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower for the purpose of
making a Payment in respect of the Loan Obligations.
 
196
 
(iv)            Each party’s obligations under this Section 8.01(c) shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or
any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction
or discharge of all Obligations under any Loan Document.
 
Section 8.02       Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may execute any of their respective duties under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof)) by or
through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters
pertaining to such duties. No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with
reasonable care. Each Agent may also from time to time, when it deems it to be necessary or desirable, appoint one or more trustees, co-trustees,
collateral co-agents, collateral subagents or attorneys-in-fact (each, a “Subagent”) with respect to all or any part of the Collateral; provided, that no
such Subagent shall be authorized to take any action with respect to any Collateral unless and except to the extent expressly authorized in writing
by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent. Should any instrument in writing from the Borrower or any other Loan Party be required by
any Subagent so appointed by an Agent to more fully or certainly vest in and confirm to such Subagent such rights, powers, privileges and duties,
the Borrower shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by
such Agent. If any Subagent, or successor thereto, shall become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all rights, powers, privileges and duties
of such Subagent, to the extent permitted by law, shall automatically vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent
until the appointment of a new Subagent. No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent, attorney-in-fact or
Subagent that it selects with reasonable care.
 
Section 8.03       Exculpatory Provisions. None of the Agents, or their respective Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys- in-fact or affiliates shall be (a) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such person under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such person’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or
(b) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any
officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or
provided for in, or received by any Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party a party
thereto to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of any Loan Party. No Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the
other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties,
regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (b) no Agent shall, except as expressly set forth herein and
in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or
any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by such Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Agents shall be deemed not to
have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the
Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or an Issuing Bank. No Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into
(i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any
certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance
of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default,
(iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or
document (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the Administrative Agent’s reliance on any Electronic Signature transmitted
by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page), or the creation, perfection
or priority of any Lien purported to be created by the Collateral Documents, (v) the value or the sufficiency of any Collateral, or (vi) the satisfaction
of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent. No Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank that obtains the benefits of Section 7.02, any Guarantee or any Collateral by
<PAGE 84 >
virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Guarantee or any Collateral Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct
or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral (including the release or impairment of
any Collateral) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory
arrangements have been made with respect to, Obligations arising under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements
unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Obligations, together with such supporting documentation as the
Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be.
 
197
 
Section 8.04       Reliance by Agents. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or
other distribution) or conversation believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper person.
Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper person, and
shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to any Credit Event, that by its terms must
be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or any Issuing Bank, each Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or
Issuing Bank unless such Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to such Credit Event. Each
Agent may consult with legal counsel (including counsel to Holdings or the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it,
and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. Each
Agent may deem and treat the Lender specified in the Register with respect to any amount owing hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes
unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with such Agent. Each Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders), and such request and any action
taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.
 
Section 8.05       Notice of Default. Neither Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
unless such Agent has received written notice from a Lender, Holdings or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or
Event of Default and stating that such notice is a “notice of default.” In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the
Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all or other Lenders); provided, that
unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take
such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the
Lenders.
 
Section 8.06       Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders. Each Lender and Issuing Bank expressly acknowledges that neither the Agents nor
any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and
that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any Affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender and Issuing Bank represents to the Agents that it has,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness
of, the Loan Parties and their affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other documents
expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any Affiliate of a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the
Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.
 
198
 
Section 8.07       Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent and the Revolving Facility Lenders agree to indemnify each Issuing
Bank, in each case, in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by Holdings or the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of
Holdings or the Borrower to do so), in the amount of its pro rata share (based on its aggregate Revolving Facility Credit Exposure and, in the case
of the indemnification of each Agent, outstanding Term Loans and unused Commitments hereunder; provided, that the aggregate principal amount
of L/C Disbursements owing to any Issuing Bank shall be considered to be owed to the Revolving Facility Lenders ratably in accordance with their
respective Revolving Facility Credit Exposure) (determined at the time such indemnity is sought), from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time
(whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent or such Issuing Bank in any way
relating to or arising out of the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to
herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent, Issuing Bank under or in
connection with any of the foregoing; provided, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent’s, Issuing Bank’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The failure of any Lender to
reimburse any Agent or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount required to be paid by the
<PAGE 85 >
Lenders to such Agent or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, as provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to
reimburse such Agent or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of
any other Lender to reimburse such Agent or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such other Lender’s ratable share of such amount. The
agreements in this Section 8.07 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
Section 8.08       Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from, and generally engage in
any kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with
respect to any Letter of Credit issued or Letter of Credit participated in, by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms “Lender” and
“Lenders” shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.
 
199
 
Section 8.09       Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 10 days’ notice to the
Lenders and the Borrower. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
then the Borrower shall have the right, subject to the reasonable consent of the Required Lenders (so long as no Event of Default under
Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case the Required Lenders shall have the right), to appoint a
successor which shall be a bank or trust company with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank or trust company with an
office in the United States, whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the
term “Administrative Agent” shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative
Agent’s rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former
Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as
Administrative Agent by the date that is 10 days following a retiring Administrative Agent’s notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative
Agent’s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the
Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Borrower (or the Required Lenders) appoint a successor agent as provided for above.
After any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 8.09 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
 
Section 8.10       Arrangers. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any provision of any other Loan Document, each of the
persons named on the cover page hereof as Joint Bookrunners or Joint Lead Arrangers is named as such for recognition purposes only, and in its
capacity as such shall have no rights, duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except that
each such person and its Affiliates shall be entitled to the rights expressly stated to be applicable to them in Sections 9.05 and 9.17 (subject to the
applicable obligations and limitations as set forth therein).
 
Section 8.11       Collateral Documents and Collateral Agent. The Lenders and the other Secured Parties authorize the Administrative Agent and
the Collateral Agent to release any Collateral or Guarantors in accordance with Section 9.18 or if approved, authorized or ratified in accordance with
Section 9.08.
 
200
 
The Lenders and the other Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize and instruct the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to, without
any further consent of any Lender or any other Secured Party, enter into (or acknowledge and consent to) or amend, renew, extend, supplement,
restate, replace, waive or otherwise modify any First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement,
any other Permitted Junior Intercreditor Agreement, any other Permitted Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement or any other intercreditor agreement
contemplated hereby with the collateral agent or other representatives of the holders of Indebtedness that is to be secured by a Lien on the
Collateral that is not prohibited (including with respect to priority) under this Agreement and to subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the
Obligations to the provisions thereof (any of the foregoing, an “Intercreditor Agreement”). The Lenders and the other Secured Parties irrevocably
agree that (x) the Collateral Agent may rely exclusively on a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower as to whether any such other Liens
are not prohibited and (y) any Intercreditor Agreement entered into by the Collateral Agent shall be binding on the Secured Parties, and each
Lender and the other Secured Parties hereby agrees that it will take no actions contrary to the provisions of, if entered into and if applicable, any
Intercreditor Agreement. The foregoing provisions are intended as an inducement to any provider of any Indebtedness not prohibited by
Section 6.01 hereof to extend credit to the Loan Parties and such persons are intended third-party beneficiaries of such provisions. Furthermore, the
Lenders and the other Secured Parties hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to release any Lien on any property
granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document (i) to the holder of any Lien on such property
that is permitted by clauses (c) (only pursuant to clause (i) of the proviso thereto), (i), (j), (p), (u), (aa), (ee), (ff) or (mm) of Section 6.02 or
Section 6.02(a) (if the Liens thereunder are of a type that is contemplated by any of the foregoing clauses) in each case to the extent the contract or
agreement pursuant to which such Lien is granted prohibits any other Liens on such property or (ii) that is or becomes an Excluded Asset; and the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall do so upon request of the Borrower; provided, that prior to any such request, the Borrower
shall have in each case delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying (x) that such Lien is
not prohibited under this Agreement, (y) in the case of a request pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence, that the contract or agreement pursuant to
which such Lien is granted prohibits any other Lien on such property and (z) in the case of a request pursuant to clause (ii) of this sentence, that
(A) such property is or has become an Excluded Asset and (B) if such property has become an Excluded Asset as a result of a contractual
restriction, such restriction does not violate Section 6.09(c).
 
Section 8.12       Right to Realize on Collateral and Enforce Guarantees. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, (i) the Administrative
Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention
in such proceeding or otherwise (A) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of any
<PAGE 86 >
or all of the Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of
the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent and any Subagents allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (B) to collect and receive
any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same, and (ii) any custodian, receiver, assignee,
trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and Issuing Bank to
make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, if the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the
Lenders and the Issuing Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements
and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under the Loan
Documents. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on
behalf of any Lender or Issuing Bank any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of
any Lender or Issuing Bank or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or Issuing Bank in any such
proceeding.
 
201
 
Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent
and each Secured Party hereby agree that (a) no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce
the Guarantee, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies hereunder may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent,
on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and all powers, rights and remedies under the Collateral Documents may be
exercised solely by the Collateral Agent, and (b) in the event of a foreclosure by the Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public
or private sale or other disposition, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of any or all of such Collateral at any such
sale or other disposition and the Collateral Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or
their respective individual capacities unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and
making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the
Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the Collateral Agent at such sale or other Disposition.
 
Section 8.13       Withholding Tax. To the extent required by any applicable Requirement of Law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any
payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. If the IRS or any authority of the United States or any other
jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for
any reason (including because the appropriate documentation was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to
notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective), such
Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent that the Administrative Agent has not already been reimbursed by any applicable
Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any applicable Loan Party to do so) fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the
Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including penalties, fines, additions to Tax and interest, together with all expenses incurred, including
legal expenses, allocated staff costs and any out of pocket expenses. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply
any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise against any amount due to
the Administrative Agent under this Section 8.13. For purposes of this Section 8.13, the term “Lender” includes any Issuing Bank. The agreements
in this Section 8.13 shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Issuing Bank, the replacement of any
Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement.

such person became a Lender party hereto to the date such person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent
and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, that at least one of the following is and will be
true:
 
(i)            such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans

certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in,
administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement,
 
(iii)            (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of

participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the
requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of

<PAGE 87 >
 
(b)            In addition, unless either sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has
provided another representation, warranty and/or covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender
further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such person
became a Lender party hereto to the date such person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for
the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, that the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary with respect
to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters
of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent
under this Agreement, any Loan Documents or any documents related to hereto or thereto).
 
203
 
(c)            Each of the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers hereby informs the Lenders that each such person is not undertaking to provide
impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and that such
person has a financial interest in the transactions contemplated hereby in that such person or an Affiliate thereof (i) may receive interest or other
payments with respect to the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, (ii) may recognize a gain if it extended the Loans,
the Letters of Credit or the Commitments for an amount less than the amount being paid for an interest in the Loans, the Letters of Credit or the
Commitments by such Lender or (iii) may receive fees or other payments in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the Loan
Documents or otherwise, including structuring fees, commitment fees, arrangement fees, facility fees, upfront fees, underwriting fees, ticking fees,
agency fees, administrative agent or collateral agent fees, utilization fees, minimum usage fees, letter of credit fees, fronting fees, deal-away or
alternate transaction fees, amendment fees, processing fees, term out premiums, banker’s acceptance fees, breakage or other early termination fees
or fees similar to the foregoing.
 
Section 8.15      Credit Bidding. The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required
Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the
Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition
vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under
Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, or (b) at any other
sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent
(whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the
Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required
Lenders on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets
on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim
amount used in allocating the contingent interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of the
acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection with such purchase). In connection with any such bid, (i) the Administrative Agent
shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, (ii) each
of the Secured Parties’ ratable interests in the Obligations which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to
be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents
providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such
acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and
the governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted assignees under the terms of this
Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of the termination of this
Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 9.02 of this Agreement), (iv) the
Administrative Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the Secured Parties, ratably on
account of the relevant Obligations which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership interests, limited partnership interests or
membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any
Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are
not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the
acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be
reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata with their original interest in such Obligations and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by
any acquisition vehicle on account of such Obligations shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition
vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Obligations of each Secured Party are deemed assigned to the
acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such documents and provide such information
regarding the Secured Party (and/or any designee of the Secured Party which will receive interests in or debt instruments issued by such
acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the
formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid.

Section 9.04      Successors and Assigns.
 
(a)            The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and

with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:
 
(A)            the Borrower, which consent, with respect to the assignment of a Loan, will be deemed to have been given if the
Borrower has not responded within ten Business Days after the delivery of any request for such consent; provided, that no
consent of the Borrower shall be required (i) for an assignment of a Loan or Commitment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an
Approved Fund, (ii) in the case of assignments during the primary syndication of the Commitments and Loans to persons
identified to and agreed by the Borrower in writing prior to the Closing Date, or (iii) for an assignment of a Term Loan, Revolving

<PAGE 89 >
 
(B)            the Administrative Agent; provided, that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment

(C)            the Issuing Banks; provided, that no consent of the Issuing Banks shall be required for an assignment of all or any

207
 
(ii)            Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
  
(A)            except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the
entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitments or Loans under any Facility, the amount of the Commitments or
Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than (x) $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof in the case of Term Loans and (y) $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof in
the case of Revolving Facility Loans or Revolving Facility Commitments, unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent otherwise consent; provided, that such amounts shall be aggregated in respect of each Lender and its Affiliates or
Approved Funds (with simultaneous assignments to or by two or more Related Funds shall be treated as one assignment), if any;
 
(B)            except as provided in Section 9.04(i), the parties to each assignment shall (1) execute and deliver to the Administrative
Agent an Assignment and Acceptance via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent or (2) if
previously agreed with the Administrative Agent, manually execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Acceptance, in each case together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee may be waived or reduced in the

(C)            the Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, Holdings or any of its subsidiaries, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Administrative Questionnaire and any tax documentation required to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.17; and
 
(D)            the Assignee shall not be the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries except in accordance with
Section 9.04(i) or a natural person.
 
For the purposes of this Section 9.04, “Approved Fund” shall mean any person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing,
holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an
Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary herein, no Lender shall be permitted to assign or transfer any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to (A) any
Ineligible Institution, (B) any Defaulting Lender or any of its Affiliates, or any person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute
any of the foregoing persons described in this clause (B), or (C) a natural person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Loan Party and the Lenders
acknowledge and agree that the Administrative Agent shall not have any responsibility or obligation to determine whether any Lender or potential
Lender is an Ineligible Institution and the Administrative Agent shall have no liability with respect to any assignment made to an Ineligible
Institution. The list of Ineligible Institutions will remain on file with the Administrative Agent and will not be subject to further disclosure by the
Administrative Agent without the Borrower’s prior written consent. Any assigning Lender shall, in connection with any potential assignment,
provide to the Borrower a copy of its request (including the name of the prospective assignee) concurrently with its delivery of the same request to
the Administrative Agent irrespective of whether or not an Event of Default under Section 7.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) has occurred and is continuing or
whether the Borrower otherwise has a consent right.
 
208
 
(iii)            Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to subclause (v) below, from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Acceptance the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder
shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement,
such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.05 (subject to
the limitations and requirements of those Sections)). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in
such rights and obligations in accordance with clause (d) of this Section 9.04 (except to the extent such participation is not permitted by
such clause (d) of this Section 9.04, in which case such assignment or transfer shall be null and void).
 
(iv)            The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its
offices a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the
Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal and interest amounts of the Loans and Revolving L/C Exposure owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and
the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Banks and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time
upon reasonable prior notice; provided, that no Lender shall, in such capacity, have access to, or be otherwise permitted to review any
<PAGE 90 >
information in the Register other than information with respect to such Lender.
 
(v)            Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee, the
Assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the Assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and
recordation fee referred to in clause (b)(ii) of this Section 9.04, if applicable, and any written consent to such assignment required by
clause (b)(i) of this Section 9.04 and any applicable tax documentation, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and promptly record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment, whether or not evidenced by a
promissory note, shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this
subclause (v).
 
209
  
(c)            [Reserved].
 
(d)            (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations in Loans and Commitments to
one or more banks or other entities other than (I) any Ineligible Institution (to the extent that the list of Ineligible Institutions has been made
available to all Lenders; provided, that regardless of whether the list of Ineligible Institutions has been made available to all Lenders, no Lender may
sell participations in Loans or Commitments to an Ineligible Institution without the consent of the Borrower if the list of Ineligible Institutions has
been made available to such Lender) or (II) any Defaulting Lender or any of its Affiliates, or any person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder,
would constitute any of the foregoing persons described in this clause (II) (a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided, that (A) such Lender’s
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to
which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided,
that (x) such agreement may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or
waiver that both (1) requires the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (vi) of the first proviso to
Section 9.08(b) and (2) directly adversely affects such Participant (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not any waiver of any Default or Event of
Default) and (y) no other agreement with respect to amendment, modification or waiver may exist between such Lender and such Participant.
Subject to clause (d)(iii) of this Section 9.04, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17
(subject to the limitations and requirements of those Sections and Section 2.19) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 9.04. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
benefits of Section 9.06 as though it were a Lender; provided, that such Participant shall be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Loan Party and the Lenders acknowledge and agree that the Administrative Agent shall not have any
responsibility or obligation to determine whether any Participant or potential Participant is an Ineligible Institution and the Administrative Agent
shall have no liability with respect to any participation made to an Ineligible Institution.
 
(ii)            Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a
register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts and interest amounts of each Participant’s
interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”). The entries in the Participant Register
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as
the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. Without limitation of the
requirements of this Section 9.04(d), no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of a Participant Register to any
person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or other
Loan Obligations under any Loan Document), except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment,
Loan or other Loan Obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations and Section 1.163-
5(b) of the United States Proposed Treasury Regulations (or any amended or successor version), or is otherwise required by applicable
law. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for
maintaining a Participant Register.

(iii)            A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender
would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent, which consent shall state that it is being given pursuant to this
Section 9.04(d)(iii); provided, that each potential Participant shall provide such information as is reasonably requested by the Borrower in
order for the Borrower to determine whether to provide its consent.
 
(e)            Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank and in the
case of any Lender that is an Approved Fund, any pledge or assignment to any holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Lender,
including to any trustee for, or any other representative of, such holders, and this Section 9.04 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of
a security interest; provided, that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or Assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
 
(f)            The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender, agrees to issue Notes to any Lender requiring Notes to facilitate
transactions of the type described in clause (e) above.
 
<PAGE 91 >
(g)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating
Lender without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent. Each of Holdings, the Borrower, each Lender and the Administrative
Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a Conduit Lender or join any other person in instituting against a Conduit Lender any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day
after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender
designating any Conduit Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto and each Loan Party for any loss,
cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of forbearance.
 
211
 
(h)            If the Borrower wishes to replace the Loans or Commitments under any Facility with ones having different terms, it shall have the option,
with the consent of the Administrative Agent and subject to at least three Business Days’ advance notice to the Lenders under such Facility,
instead of prepaying the Loans or reducing or terminating the Commitments to be replaced, to (i) require the Lenders under such Facility to assign
such Loans or Commitments to the Administrative Agent or its designees and (ii) amend the terms thereof in accordance with Section 9.08 (with
such replacement, if applicable, being deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 9.08(d)). Pursuant to any such assignment, all Loans and
Commitments to be replaced shall be purchased at par (allocated among the Lenders under such Facility in the same manner as would be required if
such Loans were being optionally prepaid or such Commitments were being optionally reduced or terminated by the Borrower), accompanied by
payment of any accrued interest and fees thereon and any amounts owing pursuant to Section 9.05(b). By receiving such purchase price, the
Lenders under such Facility shall automatically be deemed to have assigned the Loans or Commitments under such Facility pursuant to the terms
of the form of Assignment and Acceptance attached hereto as Exhibit A, and accordingly no other action by such Lenders shall be required in
connection therewith. The provisions of this clause (h) are intended to facilitate the maintenance of the perfection and priority of existing security
interests in the Collateral during any such replacement.
 
(i)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.18(c) (which provisions shall not be applicable to clauses
(i) or (j) of this Section 9.04), any of Holdings or its Subsidiaries, including the Borrower, may purchase by way of assignment and become an
Assignee with respect to Term Loans at any time and from time to time from Lenders in accordance with Section 9.04(b) hereof (each, a “Permitted
Loan Purchase”); provided, that, in respect of any Permitted Loan Purchase, (A) no Permitted Loan Purchase shall be made from the proceeds of
any extensions of credit under the Revolving Facility, (B) upon consummation of any such Permitted Loan Purchase, the Loans purchased pursuant
thereto shall be deemed to be automatically and immediately cancelled and extinguished in accordance with Section 9.04(j), (C) in connection with
any such Permitted Loan Purchase, any of Holdings or its Subsidiaries, including the Borrower and such Lender that is the assignor (an
“Assignor”) shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a Permitted Loan Purchase Assignment and Acceptance (and for the avoidance
of doubt, (x) shall make the representations and warranties set forth in the Permitted Loan Purchase Assignment and Acceptance and (y) shall not
be required to execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to Section 9.04(b)(ii)(B)) and shall otherwise comply with the
conditions to assignments under this Section 9.04 and (D) no Event of Default shall exist or would result from such Permitted Loan Purchase.
 
(j)            Each Permitted Loan Purchase shall, for purposes of this Agreement be deemed to be an automatic and immediate cancellation and
extinguishment of such Term Loans and the Borrower shall, upon consummation of any Permitted Loan Purchase, notify the Administrative Agent
that the Register be updated to record such event as if it were a prepayment of such Loans.
 
212
  
(k)            In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective
unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to
the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases
by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the
applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting
Lender to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as
appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Revolving Facility Percentage; provided
that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become
effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a
Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
 
Section 9.05      Expenses; Indemnity; Limitation of Liability.
 
(a)            The Borrower agrees to pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including Other Taxes) incurred by the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, or by the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in connection with the administration of this Agreement and any amendments, modifications or
waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof, including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of White & Case LLP,
counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Arrangers, and, if necessary, the reasonable and documented fees, charges and
disbursements of one local counsel per jurisdiction, and (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including Other Taxes) incurred
by the Agents, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in connection with the enforcement of their rights in connection with this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, in connection with the Loans made or the Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including the fees, charges and disbursements of a
single counsel for all such persons, taken as a whole, and, if necessary, a single local counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction for all such persons,
taken as a whole (and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest where such person affected by such conflict informs the Borrower of
such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel with the Borrower’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), of another firm of
counsel for such affected person).
 
(b)            The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Arrangers, the Joint Bookrunners, each Issuing
<PAGE 92 >
Bank, each Lender, each of their respective Affiliates, successors and assignors, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
trustees, advisors and members (each such person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements (excluding the allocated
costs of in house counsel and limited to not more than one counsel for all such Indemnitees, taken as a whole, and, if necessary, a single local
counsel in each appropriate jurisdiction for all such Indemnitees, taken as a whole (and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest
where the Indemnitee affected by such conflict informs the Borrower of such conflict and thereafter retains its own counsel with the Borrower’s
prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), of another firm of counsel for such affected Indemnitee)), incurred by or asserted against
any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto and thereto of their respective
obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the
Loans or the use of any Letter of Credit (including any refusal by any Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the
documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any violation of or
liability under Environmental Laws by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, (iv) any actual or alleged presence, Release or threatened Release of or
exposure to Hazardous Materials at, under, on, from or to any property owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any Subsidiary or (v) any
claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto and regardless of
whether such matter is initiated by a third party or by Holdings, the Borrower or any of their subsidiaries or Affiliates; provided, that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are
determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee or any of its Related Parties, (y) arose from a material breach of such Indemnitee’s or any of its Related Parties’
obligations under any Loan Document (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment) or (z) arose from any
claim, actions, suits, inquiries, litigation, investigation or proceeding that does not involve an act or omission of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates
and is brought by an Indemnitee against another Indemnitee (other than any claim, actions, suits, inquiries, litigation, investigation or proceeding
against any Agent, Issuing Bank, Arranger in its capacity as such).
 
213
 
(c)            None of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Arrangers, the Joint Bookrunners, the Issuing Banks, the Lenders, or any of
their respective Affiliates, successors and assignors, and any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, trustees, advisors and
members (each such person being called a “Lender-Related Person”) shall be responsible or liable to Holdings, the Borrower or any of their
respective subsidiaries, Affiliates or stockholders or any other person or entity, and none of Holdings, the Borrower or any of their respective
subsidiaries, Affiliates or stockholders shall be responsible or liable to any Lender Related Person, for any special, indirect, consequential or
punitive damages, which may be alleged as a result of the Facilities or the Transactions; provided, that this prohibition shall not limit the
indemnification obligations of the Borrower under clause (b) above with respect to claims for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
asserted against an Indemnitee. The provisions of this Section 9.05 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of
the term of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Obligations, the invalidity or
unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section 9.05 shall be payable within 15 days after written
demand therefor accompanied by reasonable documentation with respect to any reimbursement, indemnification or other amount requested.
 
(d)            Except as expressly provided in Section 9.05(a) with respect to Other Taxes, which shall not be duplicative with any amounts paid
pursuant to Section 2.17, this Section 9.05 shall not apply to any Taxes (other than Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses resulting from a non-Tax claim).
 
(e)            To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Holdings and the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waive, any claim against any
Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any
damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications,
electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.
 
(f)            The agreements in this Section 9.05 shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Issuing Bank,
the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement.
 
Section 9.06      Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each Issuing Bank is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time
or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other Indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or such Issuing Bank to or for the credit
or the account of Holdings, the Borrower or any Subsidiary against any of and all the obligations of Holdings or the Borrower now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document held by such Lender or such Issuing Bank, irrespective of whether or not such Lender
or such Issuing Bank shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan Document and although the obligations may be
unmatured; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid
over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.22 and, pending such payment,
shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the
Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and each Issuing Bank under
this Section 9.06 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that such Lender or such Issuing Bank may have.

Section 9.07      Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR
CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS) SHALL BE
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY
PRINCIPLE OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THAT COULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER LAW.
 
Section 9.08      Waivers; Amendment.
 
(a)            No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any
Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.
The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or consent to any departure by Holdings, the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be permitted by clause (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
purpose for which given. No notice or demand on Holdings, the Borrower or any other Loan Party in any case shall entitle such person to any other
or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
 
(b)            Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except
(x) as provided in Section 1.09, Section 2.14, Section 2.21, or the definition of “Refinancing Notes”, (y) in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by Holdings, the Borrower and the Required Lenders (or (A) in respect of any waiver, amendment
or modification of Section 6.11 (or any Default or Event of Default in respect thereof or component definitions as used therein), Section 7.03 or
Section 4.01 after the Closing Date, the Required Revolving Facility Lenders voting as a single Class, rather than the Required Lenders, or (B) in
respect of any waiver, amendment or modification of Section 2.11(b) or (c), the Required Prepayment Lenders, rather than the Required Lenders),
and (z) in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by each Loan Party party thereto
and the applicable Agent party thereto and consented to by the Required Lenders (unless otherwise provided in the applicable Loan Document);
provided, however, that no such agreement shall:
 
(i)            decrease or forgive the principal amount of, or extend the final maturity of, or decrease the rate of interest on, any Loan or any L/C
Disbursement, or extend the stated expiration of any Letter of Credit beyond the applicable Revolving Facility Maturity Date (except as
provided in Section 2.05(c)), without the prior written consent of each Lender directly adversely affected thereby (which, notwithstanding
the foregoing, such consent of such Lender directly adversely affected thereby shall be the only consent required hereunder to make such
modification); provided, that any amendment to the financial definitions in this Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of
interest for purposes of this clause (i),
 
215
 
(ii)            increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender, or decrease the Commitment Fees, L/C Participation Fees or any other Fees of
any Lender without the prior written consent of such Lender (which, notwithstanding the foregoing, such consent of such Lender shall be
the only consent required hereunder to make such modification); provided, that (x) waivers or modifications of conditions precedent,
covenants, Defaults or Events of Default, mandatory prepayments or of a mandatory reduction in the aggregate Commitments shall not
constitute an increase or extension of the Commitments of any Lender for purposes of this clause (ii) and (y) any amendment to the
financial definitions in this Agreement shall not constitute a decrease in the Commitment Fees for purposes of this clause (ii),
 
(iii)            extend or waive any Term Loan Installment Date or reduce the amount due on any Term Loan Installment Date or extend any
date on which payment of interest on any Loan or any L/C Disbursement or any Fees is due, without the prior written consent of each
Lender directly adversely affected thereby (which, notwithstanding the foregoing, such consent of such Lender directly adversely
affected thereby shall be the only consent required hereunder to make such modification),
 
(iv)            amend (i) the provisions of Section 7.02 with respect to the pro rata application of payments required thereby in a manner that
by its terms modifies the application of such payments required thereby to be on a less than pro rata basis or (ii) the provisions of
Section 2.18 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, in each case, without the prior written consent
of each Lender adversely affected thereby (which, notwithstanding the foregoing, such consent of such Lender directly adversely
affected thereby shall be the only consent required hereunder to make such modification),
 
(v)            amend or modify the provisions of this Section 9.08 or the definition of the terms “Required Lenders,” “Majority Lenders,”
“Required Revolving Facility Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive,
amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the prior written consent of
each Lender adversely affected thereby, in each case except, for the avoidance of doubt, as otherwise provided in Section 9.08(d) and
(e) (it being understood that, with the consent of the Required Lenders or as otherwise permitted hereunder, additional extensions of credit
pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of any requisite lenders required hereunder, including the Required
Lenders, Required Prepayment Lenders, Majority Lenders or Required Revolving Facility Lenders on substantially the same basis as the
Loans and Commitments are included on the Closing Date),
  
216
 
 
 
<PAGE 94 >
(vi)           release all or substantially all of the Collateral or all or substantially all of the Subsidiary Guarantors from their respective
Guarantees under this Agreement (in each case, other than in connection with any release of the relevant Guarantees or Collateral not
prohibited by the Loan Documents), unless all or substantially all the Equity Interests of such Subsidiary Guarantor is sold or otherwise
disposed of in a transaction not prohibited by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of each Lender other than a Defaulting
Lender,
 
(vii)          effect any waiver, amendment or modification that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect of payments or collateral of
Lenders participating in any Facility differently from those of Lenders participating in another Facility, without the consent of the Majority
Lenders participating in the adversely affected Facility except, for the avoidance of doubt, as otherwise provided in Sections 9.08(d) and
(e) (it being agreed that the Required Lenders or Required Prepayment Lenders, as applicable, may waive, in whole or in part, any
prepayment or Commitment reduction required by Section 2.11, so long as the application of any prepayment or Commitment reduction still
required to be made, if any, is not changed in a manner adverse to the Lenders participating in any such non-consenting Facility);
 
(viii)          amend or modify Section 2.01 of the First Lien/First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (or the equivalent provision in any other
Intercreditor Agreement) without the prior written consent of each Lender affected thereby;
 
(ix)            amend or modify (i) the provisions of Section 7.02 with respect to the application of payments required thereby or (ii) the
provisions of Sections 2.18(b) and (c), in each case, without the prior written consent of each Revolving Facility Lender affected thereby;
 
(x)            effect any amendment or modification that by its terms permits any payment subordination of the Obligations with respect to the
Revolving Facility to any other indebtedness or any subordination of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Obligations with respect to
the Revolving Facility to any Liens on Collateral securing any other indebtedness in each case, without the prior written consent of each
Revolving Facility Lender affected thereby unless in connection with a debtor-in-possession financing approved by the Required
Revolving Facility Lenders that does not provide for the “roll up” of any existing obligations in any proceeding under any Debtor Relief
Law; or
 
217
 
(xi)            effect any amendment or modification that by its terms permits any payment subordination of the Obligations with respect to the
Term Loans to any other indebtedness or any subordination of the Liens on the Collateral securing the Obligations with respect to the
Term Loans to any Liens on Collateral securing any other indebtedness in each case, without the prior written consent of each Lender
holding Term Loans affected thereby, unless (1) in connection with a debtor-in-possession financing approved by the Required Lenders
that does not provide for the “roll up” of any existing obligations in any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or (2) each adversely
affected Lender has been offered a reasonable bona fide opportunity to fund or otherwise provide its pro rata share (based on the amount
of Obligations that are adversely affected thereby held by each Lender and calculated immediately prior to any applicable amendment or
incurrence of senior Indebtedness) of the priming Indebtedness on the same terms (other than bona fide backstop fees and reimbursement
of counsel fees and other expenses in connection with the negotiation of the terms of such transaction; such fees and expenses,
“Ancillary Fees”) as offered to all other providers (or their Affiliates) of the priming Indebtedness and to the extent such adversely
affected Lender decides to participate in the priming Indebtedness, receive its pro rata share of the fees and any other similar benefit (other
than Ancillary Fees) of the priming Indebtedness afforded to the providers of the priming Indebtedness (or any of their Affiliates) in
connection with providing the priming Indebtedness pursuant to a written offer made to each such adversely affected Lender describing
the material terms of the arrangements pursuant to which the priming Indebtedness is to be provided, which offer shall remain open to
each adversely affected Lender for a period of not less than five (5) Business Days; provided that (x) any Lender may designate any of its
Affiliates to provide such priming Indebtedness on its behalf with the existing Obligations of such Lender being treated, for purposes
hereof, as though such Lender had provided such priming Indebtedness itself;
  
provided, further, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or an Issuing
Bank hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank acting as such at the effective date of such
agreement, as applicable. Each Lender shall be bound by any waiver, amendment or modification authorized by this Section 9.08 and any consent
by any Lender pursuant to this Section 9.08 shall bind any Assignee of such Lender.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have the right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be
affected with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may
not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all
Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender disproportionately adversely relative to other affected Lenders
shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
 
(c)            Without the consent of any Lender or Issuing Bank, the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent may (in their
respective sole discretion, or shall, to the extent required by any Loan Document) enter into any amendment, modification or waiver of any Loan
Document, or enter into any new agreement or instrument, to effect the granting, perfection, protection, expansion or enhancement of any security
interest in any Collateral or additional property to become Collateral for the benefit of the Secured Parties, to include holders of Other First Liens in
the benefit of the Collateral Documents in connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness not prohibited hereunder, or as required by local law
to give effect to, or protect any security interest for the benefit of the Secured Parties, in any property or so that the security interests therein
comply with applicable law or this Agreement or in each case to otherwise enhance the rights or benefits of any Lender under any Loan Document.
 
218
  
(d)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required
<PAGE 95 >
Lenders, the Administrative Agent, Holdings and the Borrower (a) to permit additional extensions of credit to be outstanding hereunder from time
to time and the accrued interest and fees and other obligations in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents with the Term Loans and the Revolving Facility Loans and the accrued interest and fees and other obligations in respect thereof
and (b) to include appropriately the holders of such extensions of credit in any determination of the requisite lenders required hereunder, including
Required Lenders, Required Prepayment Lenders, Majority Lenders and the Required Revolving Facility Lenders.
 
(e)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, technical and conforming modifications to the Loan Documents may be made with the consent of the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent (but without the consent of any Lender) to the extent necessary (A) to integrate any Incremental Term
Loan Commitments or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments in a manner consistent with Section 2.21, including, with respect to Other
Revolving Loans or Other Term Loans, as may be necessary to establish such Incremental Term Loan Commitments or Revolving Facility
Commitments as a separate Class or tranche from any existing Term Loans or Incremental Revolving Facility Commitments, as applicable, and, in the
case of Extended Term Loans, to reduce the amortization schedule of the related existing Class of Term Loans proportionately, (B) to effect an
alternate interest rate in a manner consistent with Section 2.14, (C) to integrate any Other First Lien Debt, (D) to cure any ambiguity, omission,
defect or inconsistency and (E) to reflect any change contemplated by Section 6.10.
 
(f)            Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may take any and all action as may be necessary to ensure that all
Term Loans established pursuant to Section 2.21 after the Closing Date that will be included in an existing Class of Term Loans outstanding on
such date (an “Applicable Date”), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans of such Class (the “Existing
Class Loans”), on a pro rata basis, and/or to ensure that, immediately after giving effect to such new Term Loans (the “New Class Loans” and,
together with the Existing Class Loans, the “Class Loans”), each Lender holding Class Loans will be deemed to hold its Pro Rata Share of each
Class Loan on the Applicable Date (but without changing the amount of any such Lender’s Term Loans), and each such Lender shall be deemed to
have effectuated such assignments as shall be required to ensure the foregoing. The “Pro Rata Share” of any Lender on the Applicable Date is the
ratio of (1) the sum of such Lender’s Existing Class Loans immediately prior to the Applicable Date plus the amount of New Class Loans made by
such Lender on the Applicable Date over (2) the aggregate principal amount of all Class Loans on the Applicable Date.
 
219
 
(g)            With respect to the incurrence of any secured or unsecured Indebtedness (including any intercreditor agreement relating thereto), the
Borrower may elect (in its discretion, but shall not be obligated) to deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Responsible Officer at least
three Business Days prior to the incurrence thereof (or such shorter time as the Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion),
together with either drafts of the material documentation relating to such Indebtedness or a description of such Indebtedness (including a
description of the Liens intended to secure the same or the subordination provisions thereof, as applicable) in reasonably sufficient detail to be
able to make the determinations referred to in this paragraph, which certificate shall either, at the Borrower’s election, (x) state that the Borrower has
determined in good faith that such Indebtedness satisfies the requirements of the applicable provisions of Sections 6.01 and 6.02 (taking into
account any other applicable provisions of this Section 9.08), in which case such certificate shall be conclusive evidence thereof, or (y) request the
Administrative Agent to confirm, based on the information set forth in such certificate and any other information reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent, that such Indebtedness satisfies such requirements, in which case the Administrative Agent may determine whether, in its
reasonable judgment, such requirements have been satisfied (in which case it shall deliver to the Borrower a written confirmation of the same), with
any such determination of the Administrative Agent to be conclusive evidence thereof, and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent
to make such determinations.

Section 9.10      Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the agreements regarding certain Fees referred to herein
constitute the entire contract between the parties relative to the subject matter hereof. Any previous agreement among or representations from the

Agreement or in the other Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto and thereto
any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.
 
Section 9.11      WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER

Section 9.12      Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions.
 
Section 9.13      Counterparts; Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents.
 
(a)            This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which, when taken
together, shall constitute but one contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section 9.03. Delivery of an executed counterpart to this
Agreement by electronic transmission pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent shall be as effective as delivery of a manually
signed original.
 
221
  
(b)           Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of (x) this Agreement, (y) any other Loan Document and/or (z) any document,
amendment, approval, consent, information, notice (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any notice delivered pursuant to Section 9.01),
certificate, request, statement, disclosure or authorization related to this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby and/or thereby (each an “Ancillary Document”) that is an Electronic Signature transmitted by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any
other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement, such other Loan Document or such Ancillary Document, as applicable. The words “execution,” “signed,”
“signature,” “delivery,” and words of like import in or relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document shall
be deemed to include Electronic Signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records in any electronic form (including deliveries by telecopy, emailed
pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page), each of which shall be of the same legal effect,
validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case
may be; provided that nothing herein shall require the Administrative Agent to accept Electronic Signatures in any form or format without its prior
written consent and pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided, further, without limiting the foregoing, (i) to the extent the Administrative
Agent has agreed to accept any Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely on such Electronic
Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Loan Party without further verification thereof and without any obligation
to review the appearance or form of any such Electronic signature and (i) upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any
Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by a manually executed counterpart. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower
and each Loan Party hereby (1) agrees that, for all purposes, including without limitation, in connection with any workout, restructuring,
enforcement of remedies, bankruptcy proceedings or litigation among the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Borrower and the Loan Parties,
Electronic Signatures transmitted by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature
page and/or any electronic images of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document shall have the same legal effect,
validity and enforceability as any paper original, (1) the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders may, at its option, create one or more copies
of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document in the form of an imaged electronic record in any format, which shall
be deemed created in the ordinary course of such person’s business, and destroy the original paper document (and all such electronic records shall
be considered an original for all purposes and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record), (1) waives any
argument, defense or right to contest the legal effect, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary
Document based solely on the lack of paper original copies of this Agreement, such other Loan Document and/or such Ancillary Document,
respectively, including with respect to any signature pages thereto and (1) waives any claim against any Lender-Related Person for any Liabilities
arising solely from the Administrative Agent’s and/or any Lender’s reliance on or use of Electronic Signatures and/or transmissions by telecopy,
emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page, including any Liabilities arising as a
result of the failure of the Borrower and/or any Loan Party to use any available security measures in connection with the execution, delivery or
transmission of any Electronic Signature.

<PAGE 97 >
 
(a)            The Borrower and each other Loan Party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not commence any action, litigation or
proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, any Lender, or any Affiliate of the foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
transactions relating hereto or thereto, in any forum other than the courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County, and of the United
States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be
heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in such federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall affect any right that
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document against any Loan Party or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction (1) for the purposes of enforcing a judgment,
(2) in connection with exercising remedies against the Collateral in a jurisdiction in which such Collateral is located or (3) to the extent the courts
referred to in the preceding sentence do not have jurisdiction over such legal action or proceeding or the parties or property subject thereto.
 
(b)           Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents in any New York State or federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
 
(c)           Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
 
223
 
Section 9.16       Confidentiality. Each of the Lenders, each Issuing Bank and each of the Agents agrees that it shall maintain in confidence any
information relating to Holdings, any Parent Entity, the Borrower, the Borrower and any Subsidiary furnished to it by or on behalf of Holdings, any
Parent Entity, the Borrower, the Borrower or any Subsidiary (other than information that (a) has become generally available to the public other than
as a result of a disclosure by such party, (b) has been independently developed by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such Agent without
violating this Section 9.16 or (c) was available to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such Agent from a third party having, to such person’s
knowledge, no obligations of confidentiality to Holdings, any Parent Entity, the Borrower or any other Loan Party) and shall not reveal the same
other than to its directors, trustees, officers, employees and advisors with a need to know and any numbering, administration or settlement service
providers or to any person that approves or administers the Loans on behalf of such Lender (so long as each such person shall have been
instructed to keep the same confidential in accordance with this Section 9.16), except: (A) to the extent necessary to comply with law or any legal
process or the requirements of any Governmental Authority, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or of any securities exchange
on which securities of the disclosing party or any Affiliate of the disclosing party are listed or traded, (B) as part of normal reporting or review
procedures to, or examinations by, Governmental Authorities or self-regulatory authorities, including the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., (C) to its parent companies, Affiliates or auditors (so long as each such person
shall have been instructed to keep the same confidential in accordance with this Section 9.16), (D) in order to enforce its rights under any Loan
Document in a legal proceeding, (E) to potential lenders, participants, investors or assignees who agree (in a customary manner) to be bound by the
terms of this Section 9.16, (F) to any actual or prospective counterparty to any swap, derivative or securitization transactions related to the
Obligations (so long as such counterparty agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 9.16), (G) to any credit insurance provider relating
to the Borrower (so long as such person agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 9.16) and (H) to any pledgee under Section 9.04(d) or
any other prospective assignee of, or prospective Participant in, any of its rights under this Agreement (so long as such person agrees to be bound
by the provisions of this Section 9.16); provided that, in the case of clause (H), no information may be provided by any Agent or, to the extent that
the list of Ineligible Institutions has been made available to a Lender or an Issuing Bank, by such Lender or such Issuing Bank, to any Ineligible
Institution or person who is known to be acting for an Ineligible Institution.
  
Section 9.17       Platform; Borrower Materials.
 
(a)            The Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make any Communications available to the Lenders
and the Issuing Banks by posting the Communications on IntraLinks™, DebtDomain, SyndTrak, ClearPar or any other electronic platform chosen
by the Administrative Agent to be its electronic transmission system (the “Approved Electronic Platform”).
 
(b)           Although the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and
policies implemented or modified by the Administrative Agent from time to time (including, as of the Closing Date, a user ID/password
authorization system) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the
Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Lenders, each of the Issuing Banks and the Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure, that the Administrative Agent is not responsible for
approving or vetting the representatives or contacts of any Lender that are added to the Approved Electronic Platform, and that there may be
confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. Each of the Lenders, each of the Issuing Banks and the Borrower hereby approves
distribution of the Communications through the Approved Electronic Platform and understands and assumes the risks of such distribution.
 
224
 
(c)            THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. THE
APPLICABLE PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS, OR
THE ADEQUACY OF THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN
THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
<PAGE 98 >
STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF
THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE APPLICABLE PARTIES IN
CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY ARRANGER OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE RELATED PARTIES (COLLECTIVELY, “APPLICABLE PARTIES”)
HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY LOAN PARTY, ANY LENDER, ANY ISSUING BANK OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR DAMAGES OF
ANY KIND, INCLUDING DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES
(WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF ANY LOAN PARTY’S OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT’S
TRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM.
 
(d)            Each Lender and each Issuing Bank agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that Communications have been
posted to the Approved Electronic Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for purposes of the Loan
Documents. Each Lender and Issuing Bank agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (which could be in the form of electronic
communication) from time to time of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s (as applicable) email address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by
electronic transmission and (i) that the foregoing notice may be sent to such email address.
 
(e)            Each of the Lenders, each of the Issuing Banks and the Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but (except as may be
required by applicable law) shall not be obligated to, store the Communications on the Approved Electronic Platform in accordance with the
Administrative Agent’s generally applicable document retention procedures and policies.
 
(f)            Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to give any notice or other
communication pursuant to any Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document.
 
225
 
(g)           The Borrower represents and warrants that each of it and its Controlling and Controlled entities, in each case, if any (collectively with the
Borrower, the “Relevant Entities”), either (i) has no SEC registered or unregistered, publicly traded securities outstanding, or (ii) files its financial
statements with the SEC and/or makes its financial statements available to potential holders of its securities, and, accordingly, the Borrower hereby
(i) authorizes the Administrative Agent to make the financial statements to be provided under Section 5.04, along with the Loan Documents,
available to Public-Siders and (ii) agrees that at the time such financial statements are provided hereunder, they shall already have been made
available to holders of any such securities. The Borrower will not request that any other material be posted to Public-Siders without expressly
representing and warranting to the Administrative Agent in writing that such materials do not constitute material non-public information within the
meaning of the federal securities laws or that the Relevant Entities have no outstanding SEC registered or unregistered, publicly traded securities.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Borrower request that the Administrative Agent make available to Public-
Siders budgets or any certificates, reports or calculations with respect to the Borrower’s compliance with the covenants contained herein.
  
Section 9.18       Release of Liens and Guarantees.
 
(a)            The Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the other Secured Parties hereby irrevocably agree that the Liens granted to the Collateral Agent by
the Loan Parties on any Collateral shall be automatically released: (i) in full upon the occurrence of the Termination Date as set forth in
Section 9.18(d) below, (ii) upon the Disposition of such Collateral (other than an operating lease) by any Loan Party to a person that is not (and is
not required to become) a Loan Party in a transaction not prohibited by this Agreement (and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a
certificate to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request without further inquiry), (iii) to the extent that such Collateral
comprises property leased to a Loan Party, upon termination or expiration of such lease (and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a
certificate to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request without further inquiry), (iv) if the release of such Lien is
approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other percentage of the Lenders whose consent may be required in
accordance with Section 9.08), (v) to the extent that the property constituting such Collateral is owned by any Guarantor, upon the release of such
Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee in accordance with clause (b) below (and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a
certificate to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request without further inquiry), (vi) as provided in Section 8.11 (and
the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request without
further inquiry), (vii) as provided in Section 1.09 and (viii) as required by the Collateral Agent to effect any Disposition of Collateral in connection
with any exercise of remedies of the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Collateral Documents. Any such release (other than pursuant to clause
(i) above) shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those being released) upon (or obligations
(other than those being released) of the Loan Parties in respect of) all interests retained by the Loan Parties, including the proceeds of any
Disposition, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral except to the extent otherwise released in accordance with the provisions
of the Loan Documents.
 
226
 
(b)            In addition, the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the other Secured Parties hereby irrevocably agree that (x) the Guarantors shall be
automatically released from the Guarantees upon consummation of any transaction not prohibited hereunder resulting in such person ceasing to
exist or constitute a Loan Party or otherwise becoming an Excluded Subsidiary (and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate to
that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its reasonable request without further inquiry); provided that, if any Subsidiary Guarantor
becomes a non-Loan Party or an Excluded Subsidiary as a result of ceasing to be Wholly Owned, directly or indirectly, by the Borrower, such
Subsidiary shall not be released from its Guarantee unless (i) it is no longer a Subsidiary of the Borrower pursuant to a transaction permitted by the
Loan Documents (other than a disposition to an Affiliate of the Borrower or any Permitted Holder, in which case no such release shall be permitted)
and (ii) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (y) the Guarantee of Holdings shall be automatically released as
provided in Section 1.09, and (z) any Subsidiary Guarantor that became a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of
“Subsidiary Guarantor” shall be automatically released from the Guarantees upon the request of the Borrower so long as such Subsidiary Guarantor
would constitute an Excluded Subsidiary if it were not a Subsidiary Guarantor.
<PAGE 99 >
  
(c)           The Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the other Secured Parties hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, as
applicable, to execute and deliver any instruments, documents, and agreements necessary or desirable to evidence and confirm the release of any
Guarantor or Collateral pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.18 and to return to Holdings or the Borrower all possessory collateral
(including share certificates (if any)) held by it in respect of any Collateral so released, all without the further consent or joinder of any Lender or
any other Secured Party. Any representation, warranty or covenant contained in any Loan Document relating to any such Collateral or Guarantor
shall no longer be deemed to be made. In connection with any release hereunder, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall promptly
(and the Secured Parties hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to) take such action and execute any such documents
as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower and at the Borrower’s expense in connection with the release of any Liens created by any Loan
Document in respect of such person, property or asset; provided, that the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate of a Responsible
Officer of the Borrower containing such certifications as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request and any such release shall be without
recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent.
 
(d)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Loan Document, on the Termination Date, all Liens granted to the
Collateral Agent by the Loan Parties on any Collateral and all obligations of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties under any Loan Documents
(other than such obligations that expressly survive the Termination Date pursuant to the terms hereof) shall, in each case, be automatically released
and, upon request of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall (without notice to, or vote or consent
of, any Secured Party) take such actions as shall be required to evidence the release of its security interest in all Collateral (including returning to
Holdings or the Borrower all possessory collateral (including all share certificates (if any)) held by it in respect of any Collateral), and to evidence
the release of all obligations under any Loan Document (other than such obligations that expressly survive the Termination Date pursuant to the
terms hereof), whether or not on the date of such release there may be any (i) obligations in respect of any Secured Hedge Agreements or any
Secured Cash Management Agreements and (ii) any contingent indemnification obligations or expense reimburse claims not then due and payable;
provided, that the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower containing such certifications as
the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request. Any such release of obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision that such obligations
shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of any payment in respect of the obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded, avoided, or
must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or any
Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any
Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. The Borrower agrees to pay all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (and their respective
representatives) in connection with taking such actions to release security interest in all Collateral and all obligations under the Loan Documents as
contemplated by this Section 9.18(d).
 
227
 
(e)           Obligations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries under any Secured Cash Management Agreement or Secured Hedge Agreement
(after giving effect to all netting arrangements relating to such Secured Hedge Agreements) shall be secured and guaranteed pursuant to the
Collateral Documents only to the extent that, and for so long as, the other Obligations are so secured and guaranteed. No person shall have any
voting rights under any Loan Document solely as a result of the existence of obligations owed to it under any such Secured Hedge Agreement or
Secured Cash Management Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no release of Collateral or Guarantors effected in the manner permitted by this
Agreement shall require the consent of any holder of obligations under any Secured Hedge Agreements or Secured Cash Management
Agreements.
 
(f)            In connection with any release pursuant to this Section 9.18, (i) the Collateral Agent may conclusively rely on a certificate of an officer of
the Borrower or the Borrower as to whether any termination or release is permitted and (ii) each Secured Party (other than the Collateral Agent)
hereby agrees to deliver any instruction or direction as necessary or as may be reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document.
 
Section 9.19        Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or
any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal
banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on
which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than that in
which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “Agreement Currency”), be discharged only
to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency,
the Administrative Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the
amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent from the Borrower in the
Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative
Agent or the person to whom such obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than
the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to the
Borrower (or to any other person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).
 
228
  
Section 9.20       USA PATRIOT Act Notice Etc. Each Lender that is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation and
the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA
PATRIOT Act and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which
information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as
applicable, to identify each Loan Party in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation.
 
<PAGE 100 >
Section 9.21       [Reserved].
 
Section 9.22       Agency of the Borrower for the Loan Parties. Each of the other Loan Parties hereby appoints the Borrower as its agent for all
purposes relevant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including the giving and receipt of notices and the execution and delivery of
all documents, instruments and certificates contemplated herein and therein and all modifications hereto and thereto.
 
Section 9.23       No Liability of the Issuing Banks. The Borrower assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any
Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither any Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or
responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection
therewith; (b) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in
any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by such Issuing Bank against presentation of documents that do not
comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to the Letter of Credit; or
(d) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, except that the Borrower shall have a claim
against such Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not consequential, damages
suffered by the Borrower that the Borrower proves were caused by (i) such Issuing Bank’s willful misconduct or gross negligence as determined in
a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in determining whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit
comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) such Issuing Bank’s willful failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after the
presentation to it of a draft and certificates strictly complying with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, such Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary.
 
229
 
Section 9.24       Acknowledgment and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Solely to the extent any Lender or Issuing Bank that is
an Affected Financial Institution is a party to this Agreement and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other
agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender or Issuing Bank
that is an Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-
Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
 
(a)           the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder
which may be payable to it by any Lender or Issuing Bank that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
 
(b)           the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
 
(i)            a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
 
(ii)            a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial
Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or
other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document; or
 
(iii)            the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the
applicable Resolution Authority.
 
Section 9.25       Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee
or otherwise, for any Swap Obligation or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support”, and each such
QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together
with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support
(with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by
the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
 
230
 
In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special
Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under
such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from
such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported
QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a
state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S.
Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit
Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be
exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States
or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect
to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

Guarantee
<PAGE 101 >
 
Section 10.01      The Guarantee. Each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally with the other Guarantors guarantees, as a primary obligor and not as
a surety to each Secured Party and their respective successors and assigns, the prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by
required prepayment, declaration, demand, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest (including any interest, fees, costs or
charges that would accrue but for the provisions of (i) the Title 11 of the United States Code after any bankruptcy or insolvency petition under Title
11 of the United States Code and (ii) any other Debtor Relief Laws) on the Loans made by the Lenders to, and the Notes, if any, held by each Lender
of, the Borrower (other than such Guarantor), and all other Obligations (other than with respect to any Guarantor, Excluded Swap Obligations of
such Guarantor) from time to time owing to the Secured Parties by any Loan Party under any Loan Document or the Borrower or any Subsidiary
under any Secured Hedge Agreement or any Secured Cash Management Agreement, in each case strictly in accordance with the terms thereof
(such obligations being herein collectively called the “Guaranteed Obligations”). The Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agree that if the
Borrower or other Guarantor(s) shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, the Guarantors will promptly pay the same in cash, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of
time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.
 
Section 10.02      Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 10.01 shall constitute a guaranty of payment and to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, are absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of the value, genuineness,
validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes, if any, or any other agreement
or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, and, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or Guarantor (except for payment in full). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more
of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of the Guarantors hereunder which shall remain absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under
any and all circumstances as described above:
 
(i)             at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Guarantors, to the extent permitted by Law, the time for any performance of
or compliance with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived;
 
231
 
(ii)            any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or instrument
referred to herein or therein shall be done or omitted;
 
(iii)            the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be amended in
any respect, or any right under the Loan Documents or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be amended or
waived in any respect or any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or except as permitted pursuant to Section 9.18, any
security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;
 
(iv)            any Lien or security interest granted to, or in favor of, an Issuing Bank or any Lender or Agent as security for any of the
Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be perfected; or
 
(v)            the release of any other Guarantor pursuant to Section 9.18 or otherwise.
 
The Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and, to the extent permitted by Law, all notices
whatsoever, and any requirement that any Secured Party exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against the Borrower under this Agreement
or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or against any other person under any other guarantee of, or
security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantors waive, to the extent permitted by Law, any and all notice of the creation, renewal,
extension, waiver, termination or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by any Secured Party upon this
Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee, and the Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created,
contracted or incurred in reliance upon this Guarantee, and all dealings between the Borrower and the Secured Parties shall likewise be conclusively
presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee. This Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute,
irrevocable and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to any right of offset with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations at any time or
from time to time held by Secured Parties, and the obligations and liabilities of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be conditioned or contingent
upon the pursuit by the Secured Parties or any other person at any time of any right or remedy against the Borrower or against any other person
which may be or become liable in respect of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or against any collateral security or guarantee therefor or
right of offset with respect thereto. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its
terms upon the Guarantors and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall inure to the benefit of the Lenders, and their respective successors
and assigns, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this Agreement there may be no Guaranteed Obligations outstanding.
 
232
 
Section 10.03      Reinstatement. The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article X shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for
any reason any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or other Loan Party in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be
otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or
otherwise.
 
Section 10.04      Subrogation; Subordination. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that until the payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all Guaranteed
Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitments of the Lenders under this Agreement it shall waive any claim and shall not
exercise any right or remedy, direct or indirect, arising by reason of any performance by it of its guarantee in Section 10.01, whether by subrogation
or otherwise, against the Borrower or any other Guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed
<PAGE 102 >
Obligations. Any Indebtedness of any Loan Party permitted pursuant to Section 6.01(e) shall be subordinated to such Loan Party’s Obligations in
the manner set forth in the Intercompany Note evidencing such Indebtedness.
 
Section 10.05      Remedies. The Guarantors jointly and severally agree that, as between the Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of the
Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes, if any, may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 8.02 (and shall be
deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Section 8.02) for purposes of Section 10.01,
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and
payable) as against the Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due
and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for
purposes of Section 10.01.
 
Section 10.06      Instrument for Payment of Money. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article X constitutes an
instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that any Lender or Agent, at its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such
Guarantor in the payment of any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to bring a motion-action under New York CPLR Section 3213.
 
Section 10.07      Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this Article X is a continuing guarantee of payment, and shall apply to all Guaranteed
Obligations whenever arising.
 
233
 
Section 10.08      General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate limited partnership or
limited liability company law, or any applicable state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Law affecting the rights of
creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 10.01 would otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or
unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 10.01, then,
notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Guarantor, any Loan
Party or any other person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount (after giving effect to the right of contribution established in
Section 10.09) that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding.
 
Section 10.09      Right of Contribution. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a Subsidiary Guarantor shall have paid more than its
proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against
any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of such payment. Each Subsidiary Guarantor’s right of contribution shall
be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 10.04. The provisions of this Section 10.09 shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of
any Subsidiary Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders, and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall remain liable to the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders for the full amount guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder.
 
Section 10.10      Keepwell. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally, absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to
provide such funds or other support to each Specified Guarantor as may be needed by such Specified Guarantor from time to time to honor all of its
obligations under its Guaranty and the other Loan Documents in respect of any Swap Obligation (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP
Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 10.10 for up to the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering
such Qualified ECP Guarantor’s obligations and undertakings under this Article X voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance
or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount). The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 10.10
shall remain in full force and effect until the date upon which all Commitments under this Agreement have been terminated and all Obligations have
been indefeasibly paid and performed in full. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 10.10 constitute, and this Section 10.10 shall be
deemed to constitute, a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit of each Specified Guarantor for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)
(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
